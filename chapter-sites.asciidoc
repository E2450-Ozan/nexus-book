== Deploying Sites to Nexus

[[sites-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

Nexus provides a repository provider for hosting static websites - the
"Site" format. Hosted repositories with this format can be used to
hold a Maven-generated web site. This chapter details the process of
configuring a site repository and configuring a simple Maven
project to publish a Maven-generated project site to an instance of
Nexus.


=== Creating a New Maven Project

In this chapter, you will be creating a simple Maven project with a
simple web site that will be published to a Nexus Site repository. To
create a new Maven project, use the archetype plugin's
archetype:generate goal on the command line, and supply the following
identifiers:

* groupId: org.sonatype.books.nexus

* artifactId: sample-site

* version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT

* package: org.sonatype.books.nexus

----
~/examples$ mvn archetype:generate

After running the archetype:generate command you
will have a new project in a sample-site/
subdirectory.


=== Configuring Maven for Site Deployment

To deploy a site to a Nexus Site repository, you will need to
configure the project's distribution management settings, add site
deployment information, and then update your Maven settings to include
the appropriate credentials for Nexus.

Add the following section to sample-site/pom.xml before the
dependencies element.  This section will tell Maven where to publish
the Maven-generated project web site:

[[ex-sites-dist-man]]
.Distribution Management for Site Deployment to Nexus
----
<distributionManagement>
  <site>
    <id>nexus-site</id>
    <url>dav:http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/sites/site/</url>
  </site>
</distributionManagement>
----

NOTE: In <<ex-sites-dist-man>>, there is a Nexus installation running
on localhost port 8081. In your environment you will need to customize
this URL to point to your own Nexus instance.

The url in the distribution management is not parameterized, which
means that any redeployment overwrites old content and potentially
leaves old stale files behind. To have a new deployment directory for
each version you can change the url to a parameterized setup.


[[ex-sites-dist-parameterized]]
.Parameterized Distribution Management for Site Deployment
----
<url>
dav:http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/sites/site/${project.groupId}/${project.artifactId}/${project.version}
</url>
----

If you combine this approach with a redirector or a static page that
links to the different copies of your site you can e.g., maintain
separate sites hosting your javadoc and other documentation for
different release of your software.

The dav protocol used by for deployment to Nexus requires that you add
the implementing library as a build extension to your Maven project:

[[ex-sites-dav]]
.Build Extension for DAV Support
----
 <build>
   <extensions>
      <extension>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.wagon</groupId>
        <artifactId>wagon-webdav-jackrabbit</artifactId>
        <version>2.6</version>
      </extension>
    </extensions>
----

In addition to the distributionManagement element and the build
extension, you will want to add the following build element that will
configure Maven to use version 3.2 of the Maven Site plugin.

.Configuring Version 3.2 of the Maven Site Plugin
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.3</version>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----


=== Adding Credentials to Your Maven Settings

When the Maven Site plugin deploys a site to Nexus, it needs to
supply the appropriate deployment credentials to Nexus. To configure
this, you need to add credentials to your Maven Settings.  Open
up your ~/.m2/settings.xml and add the following server configuration
to the servers element.

[[ex-sites-deploy-credentials]]
.Configuring Deployment Credentials for Nexus Site Deployment
----
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>nexus-site</id>
      <username>deployment</username>
      <password>deployment123</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
----

NOTE: <<ex-sites-deploy-credentials>>, uses the default
deployment user and the default deployment user password. You will need
to configure the username and password to match the values expected by
your Nexus installation.

=== Creating a Site Repository

To create a site repository, log in as a user with Administrative
privileges, and click on "Repositories" under Views/Repositories in
the Nexus menu. Under the Repositories tab, click on the
Add... drop-down and choose "Hosted Repository" as shown in
<<fig-sites-add-hosted>>.

[[fig-sites-add-hosted]]
.Adding a Hosted Repository
image::figs/web/sites-add-hosted.png[scale=60]

In the New Hosted Repository form, click on the Provider
drop-down and chose the Site provider as shown in
<<fig-sites-new-site-repo>>. Although you can use any arbitrary name
and identifier for your own Nexus repository, for the chapter's
example, use a Repository ID of "site" and a Repository Name of "Maven
Site".

[[fig-sites-new-site-repo]]
.Creating a New Maven Site Repository
image::figs/web/sites-new-repo.png[scale=60]

After creating a new Site repository, it should appear in the list of
Nexus repositories as shown in <<fig-sites-newly-created>>. Note that
the Repository Path shown in <<fig-sites-newly-created>>, is the same
as the repository path referenced in <<ex-sites-dist-man>>.

[[fig-sites-newly-created]]
.Newly Created Site Repository
image::figs/web/sites-new-repo-listed.png[scale=60]

TIP: The Site provider support is implemented in the Nexus Site
Repository Plugin and is installed by default in Nexus Open Source as
well as Nexus Professional.

=== Add the Site Deployment Role

In the Maven Settings shown in <<ex-sites-deploy-credentials>>, you
configured your Maven instance to use the default deployment user and
password. To successfully deploy a site to Nexus, you will need to
make sure that the deployment user has the appropriate role and
permissions. To add the site deployment role to the deployment user,
click on Users under the Security section of the Nexus menu, and click
on the Add button the Role Management section. This will trigger the
display of the Add Role dialog that will allow you to apply a filter
value of Site to locate the applicable roles as shown in <<fig-sites-add-role>>.

[[fig-sites-add-role]]
.Adding the Site Deployment Role to the Deployment User
image::figs/web/sites-deploy-role.png[scale=60]

Check the box beside the "Repo: All Site Repositories (Full Control)"
role in the list and press OK in the dialog. After the dialog closed,
you should see the new role in the Role Management section. Click on
the Save button to update the roles for the deployment user. The
deployment user now has the ability to publish sites to a Maven Site
repository.

=== Publishing a Maven Site to Nexus

To publish a site to a Maven Site repository in Nexus,
run mvn site-deploy from the sample-site/ project created earlier
in this chapter.  The Maven Site plugin will deploy this site to Nexus
using the credentials stored in your Maven Settings.
