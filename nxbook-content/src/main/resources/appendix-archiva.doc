== Migrating to Nexus from Archiva

[[archiva-sect-introduction]]
=== Introduction

This appendix walks you through the process of migrating an
existing Archiva installation to a new Nexus installation.

=== Migrating Archiva Repositories

Archive uses the filesystem to store hosted repositories and
proxied repositories, because of this migrating from Archiva to Nexus
couldn't be simpler. The following sections outline the process for
migrating existing Archiva repositories to a new Nexus instance.

[[sect-archiva-migrating-managed]]
=== Migrating an Archiva Managed Repository

Archiva Managed Repositories are the equivalent of Nexus
Hosted repositories. To migrate a Managed Repository from Archiva to
Nexus, all you need to do is:

* Create a New Hosted Repository in Nexus

* Copy the Contents of the Archiva Managed Repository to the Storage
Directory of the newly-created Nexus Hosted Repository

* Rebuild the Index for the New Nexus Hosted Repository

The following example will walk through the process of migrating the
Archiva repository named "internal" to a new Nexus Hosted repository
named "internal". To view your managed repositories in Archiva, login
to Archiva as an administrative user and click on the "Repositories"
link in the left-hand navigation menu. Clicking on "Repositories" will
list all of your Archiva Managed repositories as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-archiva-managed" />.

To migrate this Managed repository to a Nexus Hosted repository, you
will need to find the directory in which Archiva stores all of the
repository artifacts. to do this, click on the Edit link listed next
to the name of the repository you want to migrate as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-archiva-managed" />. Click on Edit should load the form
shown in <xref linkend="fig-archiva-managed-edit" />.

[[fig-archiva-managed-edit]]
.Editing an Archiva Managed Repository

Take note of the file path for Directory. The file path shown in <xref
linkend="fig-archiva-managed-edit" /> is
./data/repositories/internal. If Archiva is installed in
/usr/local/archiva-1.2.1, this would correspond to the
directory
/usr/local/archiva-1.2.1/data/repositories/internal.  You
will use this path later in this section to copy the contents of your
old Archiva Managed Repository to your new Nexus Hosted Repository.

Next, create a new Nexus repository with the same identifier and Name
as the old Archiva Managed Repository. To do this, log into Nexus as
an administrative user, click on Repositories in the left-hand Nexus
navigation menu, and then click on the Add dropdown as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-archiva-new-nexus-hosted" />. Select "Hosted Repository"
and then fill out the Repository ID and Repository Name to match the
name of the old Archiva repository. If you are migrating a Snapshot
repository, select a Repository Policy of Snapshot, and if you are
migrating a Release repository select a Snapshot Policy of Release.

Now, you'll need to copy the Archiva repository to the Nexus
repository. You can do this, by copying the contents of the Archiva
repository directory to the Nexus repository storage directory. If we
assume that Archiva is install in /usr/local/archiva-1.2.1, Nexus is
install in /usr/local/nexus-1.3.6, and the Sonatype Work directory is
/usr/local/sonatype-work. You can copy the contents of the Archiva
managed repository to the new Nexus hosted repository by executing the
following command:

----
$ cp -r /usr/local/archiva-1.2.1/data/repositories/internal/* \
/usr/local/sonatype-work/nexus/storage/internal/
----

If you are migrating to a Nexus instance which is on a different
server, you can simply create an archive of the
/usr/local/archiva-1.2.1/data/repositories/internal directory, copy it
to the new server, and then uncompress your repository archive in the
appropriate directory.

WARNING: Archiva stores artifacts from proxied remote repositories in
the same directory as artifacts in a managed repository. If you have
been proxying a remote repository, you might want to remove artifacts
that have been proxied from a remote repository. For example, if your
organization uses a groupId of org.company for internal project, you
can make sure to only copy the artifacts under the corresponding
org/company/

Once the contents of the repository have been copied to the Nexus
Hosted repository, you must rebuild the repository index as shown in
<xref linkend="figu-archiva-nx-hosted-idx" />. Right-clicking on the
repository in the list of Nexus repositories will display the context
menu shown in the following figure.

Once the migration is complete, you will be able to search and browse
the contents of your newly migrated Nexus Hosted repository.

=== Migrating an Archiva Proxy Connector

Archiva allows you to define remote repositories and repository
connectors to proxy remote repositories and cache remote artifacts
from remote repositories in Archiva Managed Repositories.  While Nexus
also provides Proxy repositories, there is one major difference
between Nexus and Archiva. Where Nexus maintains a separate local
storage directory for each proxy repository, Archiva combines cached
remote artifacts into a single filesystem with the contents of a
managed repository. In other words, there is no good way to transfer
an existing local cache of artifacts between Archiva and Nexus without
manually manipulating the contents of Archiva's Managed Repository
directory.

To recreate an Archiva repository connector in Nexus as a Proxy
repository and to preserve the local cache of artifacts from this
repository. You'll need to create a Proxy repository in Nexus, copy
the contents of the existing proxy repository to the Nexus storage
location for you new Proxy repository, and then rebuild the metadata
of your new Nexus Proxy repository.

First step is to take a look at the Remote Repositories in your
Archiva installation: log in as an administrative user and then click
on "Repositories" under the Administration menu in the left-hand
Archiva navigation menu. Once you've clicked this link and loaded the
list of repositories, scrool to the bottom of the page to see the list
of remote repositories as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-archiva-browsing-remote" />.

[[fig-archiva-browsing-remote]]
.Browsing Archiva Remote Repositories

Defining a proxy repository in Archiva involves associating one of the
remote repositories defined in <xref
linkend="fig-archiva-browsing-remote" /> with one of the Managed
Repositories defined in <xref linkend="fig-archiva-managed" />. Once
you do this, requests for artifacts from the managed repository will
also query the remote repository. If an artifact is found in the
remote repository, it will be retrieved and stored in the managed
repository's storage directory. To see a list of proxy connectors and
the managed repositories they are associated with, click on "Proxy
Connectors" in the left-hand Archiva menu, you will see a list similar
to that shown in <xref linkend="fig-archiva-proxy-connectors" />.

Click on the Edit Icon (or Pencil) next to second Proxy Connector
listed in <xref linkend="fig-archiva-proxy-connectors" />, this will
then load the settings form for this proxy connector shown in <xref
linkend="fig-archiva-proxy-connector-settings" />. You should use the
settings for this proxy connect to configure your new Nexus Proxy
repository.

[[fig-archiva-proxy-connector-settings]]

To create a Proxy repository that will correspond to the Proxy
Connector in Archiva, log into Nexus as an administrative user, and
click on Repositories in the left-hand Nexus menu. Once you can see a
list of Nexus repositories, click on Add... and select Proxy
Repository from the dropdown of repository types. In the New Proxy
Repository form (shown in <xref linkend="fig-archiva-nx-create-proxy"
/>) populate the repository ID, repository Name, and use the remote
URL that was displayed in <xref linkend="fig-archiva-browsing-remote"
/>. You will need to create a remote repository for every proxy
connector that was defined in Archiva.

[[fig-archiva-nx-create-proxy]]
.Creating a Nexus Proxy Repository

To expose this new Proxy repository in a Repository Group, create a
new Nexus Repository group or select an existing group by clicking on
Repositories in the left-hand Nexus menu. Click on a repository group
and then select the Configuration tab to display the form shown in
<xref linkend="fig-archiva-proxy-to-group" />. In the Configuration
tab you will see a list of Order Group Repositories and Available
Repositories.  Click and drag your new Nexus Proxy repository to the
list of Ordered Group Repositories, and click Save.

.Adding a Proxy Repository to a Repository Group

Next, you will need to define repository groups that will tell Nexus
to only locate certain artifacts in the newly created proxy
repository. In , Archiva defined three patterns that were used to
filter artifacts available from the proxy connector. These three
patterns were "javax/**", "com/sun/**", and "org/jvnet/**". To
recreate this behavior in Nexus, define three Routes which will be
applied to the group you configured in <xref
linkend="fig-archiva-proxy-to-group" />. To create a route, log in as
an administrative user, and click on Routes under the Administration
menu in the left-hand Nexus menu. Click on Add.. and add three
inclusive routes that will apply to the repository group you
configured in <xref linkend="fig-archiva-proxy-to-group" />.
