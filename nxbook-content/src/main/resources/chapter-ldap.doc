== Nexus LDAP Integration

Nexus Open Source has a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) Authentication realm which provides Nexus with the
capability to authenticate users against an LDAP server.  In
addition to handling authentication, Nexus can be configured to map
Nexus roles to LDAP user is a member of a group that matches
the ID of a Nexus role, Nexus will grant that user the matching Nexus
Role. In addition to this highly configurable user and group mapping
capability, Nexus can augment LDAP group membership with
Nexus-specific user-role mapping.

Nexus Professional offers LDAP support features for enterprise LDAP
deployments including the ability to cache authentication information,
support for multiple LDAP servers and backup mirrors, the ability to test
user logins, support for common user/group mapping templates, and the
ability to support more than one schema across multiple servers.

=== Enabling the LDAP Authentication Realm

Authentication realm, you will need to add the Nexus LDAP
Authentication Realm to the Selected Realms in the Security section of
the Server configuration panel. To load the Server configuration
panel, click on the Server link under Administration in the Nexus
menu. Once you have the Server configuration panel loaded, select OSS
LDAP Authentication Realm in the Available Realms list under the
Security section and click the Add button (or Left Arrow) as shown in
<xref linkend="fig-ldap-selecting-realm" xrefstyle="select: label" />.

[[fig-ldap-selecting-realm]]
.Adding the LDAP Authentication Realm to Available Realms
image:figs/web/ldap_moving_ldap_realm_over.png[]

Next, click on the Save button in the Server configuration panel. To
make sure that your Nexus instance attempts to authenticate against
LDAP first, click on the OSS LDAP Authentication Realm in the Selected
Realms list and drag it to the top of the list as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-ldap-move-realm-to-top" xrefstyle="select: label"
/>. This will ensure that Nexus will consult the LDAP Server before it
consults the other Authentication Realms.

NOTE: Nexus will continue to fall-back to the Xml Authenticating Realm
if it cannot authenticate a user against the LDAP server. If your LDAP
server is unavailable, and you need to reconfigure the LDAP
connection, you can always login as the default admin

=== Configuring Nexus LDAP Integration

To configure LDAP integration, click on the LDAP Configuration link in
the Nexus menu as shown in <xref linkend="fig-ldap-config-link"
xrefstyle="select: label" />. LDAP Configuration is under Security in
the Nexus menu.

[[fig-ldap-config-link]]

image:figs/web/ldap_loading_ldap_configuration_panel.png[]

Clicking on the LDAP Configuration link will load the LDAP
Configuration panel as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-ldap-connection-authentication" xrefstyle="select: label"
/> and <xref linkend="fig-ldap-user-mapping" xrefstyle="select: label"
/>.  The following sections outline the configuration options
available in the LDAP Configuration Panel.

[[ldap-sect-connect-auth]]
=== Connection and Authentication

The following figure shows Nexus configured to connect to an LDAP
server running on localhost port 10389 using the search base of
"ou=system". On a more standard installation, you would likely not
want to use Simple Authentication as it sends the password in clear
text over the network, and you would also use a search base which
corresponds to your organization's top-level domain components such as
"dc=sonatype,dc=com".

[[fig-ldap-connection-authentication]]
image:figs/web/ldap_configure_connection_and_authentication.png[]

<xref linkend="tbl-ldap-connection-config" xrefstyle="select: label"
/> and <xref linkend="tbl-ldap-authentication-config"
xrefstyle="select: label" /> contain detailed descriptions of the
configuration fields in both the Connection and Authentication
sections of the LDAP Configuration panel.

.Connection Configuration for LDAP Integration
|====
|Field Name|Description|
|Protocol|
Valid values in this dropdown are ldap
and ldaps which correspond to the Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol and the Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol over SSL

|Hostname|
The hostname or IP address of the
LDAP

|Port|
The port on which the LDAP server is
listening. Port 389 is the default port for the
ldap protocol, and port 636 is the default port
for the ldaps

|Search Base|
The search base is the Distinguished Name
(DN) to be appended to the
LDAP. The search base
usually corresponds to the domain name of an organization. For
example, the search base on the Sonatype LDAP
server is "dc=sonatype,dc=com"
|====

.Authentication Configuration for LDAP Integration
|====
|Field Name|Description|
|Authentication Method|

Nexus provides four distinct authentication methods to be used when
connecting to the LDAP Server:

Simple Authentication:: Simple authentication is not recommended for
production deployments not using the secure ldaps protocol as it sends
a cleartext password over the network.

Anonymous Authentication:: Used when Nexus only needs read-only access
to non-protected entries and attributes when binding to the LDAP

Digest-MD5:: This is an improvement on the CRAM-MD5 authentication
method. For more information, see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2831.txt

CRAM-MD5:: The Challenge-Response Authentication Method (CRAM) based
on the HMAC-MD5 MAC algorithm. In this authentication method, the
server sends a challenge string to the client, the client responds
with a username followed by a Hex digest which the server compares to
an expected value. For more information, see RFC 2195

For a full discussion of LDAP authentication approaches, see
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2829.txt and
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt

|SASL Realm|

The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Realm to connect
with. The SASL Realm is only available if the authentication method is
Digest-MD5 or CRAM-MD5.

|Username|

Username of an LDAP User to connect (or bind) with. This is a
Distinguished Name of a user who has read access to all users and
groups

|Password|

Password for an Administrative LDAP User

|====

[[ldap-sect-user-group-mapping]]
===User and Group Mapping

The LDAP Configuration panel also contains sections to manage User
Element Mapping and Group Element Mapping as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-ldap-user-mapping" xrefstyle="select: label" />.

[[fig-ldap-user-mapping]]
image:figs/web/ldap_configure_user_mapping.png[]

The fields for both the User Element Mapping and Group Element Mapping
sections are described in detail in <xref
linkend="tbl-ldap-user-element-config" xrefstyle="select: label" />
and <xref linkend="tbl-ldap-group-element-config" xrefstyle="select:
label" />.

.User Element Mapping Configuration for LDAP Integration
|====
|Field Name|Description|
|Base DN|

Corresponds to the Base DN containing user entries. This DN
is going to be relative to the Search Base which was specified in
<xref linkend="fig-ldap-connection-authentication"
xrefstyle="select: label" />. For example, if your users are all
contained in "ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com" and
you specified a Search Base of
"dc=sonatype,dc=com" you would use a value of
"ou=users"

|User Subtree|

True if there is a tree below the Base DN which can contain
user entries. False if all users are contain within the specified
Base DN. For example, if all users are in
"ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com" this field should
be false. If users can appear in organizational units within
organizational units such as
"ou=development,ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com"
this field should be true.

|Object Class|

This value defaults to inetOrgPerson
which is a standard object class defined in <ulink
url="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2798.html">RFC 2798.
inetOrgPerson contains standard fields such
as mail,
uid. Other possible
values are posixAccount or a custom
class.

|User ID Attribute|

This is the attribute of the Object class which supplies
the User ID. Nexus will use this attribute as the Nexus User
ID.

|Real Name Attribute|

This is the attribute of the Object class which supplies
the real name of the user. Nexus will use this attribute when it
needs to display the real name of a user.

|E-Mail Attribute|

This is the attribute of the Object class which supplies
the email address of the user. Nexus will use this attribute when
it needs to send an email to a user.

|Password Attribute|

This is the attribute of the Object class which supplies
the password of the user. Nexus will use this attribute when it is
authenticating a user against an LDAP
server.

|Password Encoding|

Defines the preferred password encoding mechanism to be
used when sending password data to the LDAP
server.

|====


.Group Element Mapping Configuration for LDAP Integration
|====
|Field Name|Description|
|Group Type|

Groups are generally one of two types in
LDAP systems - static or dynamic. A static
group contains a list of users. A dynamic group is where the user
contains a list of groups the user belongs to. In
LDAP a static group would be captured in an
entry with an Object class groupOfUniqueNames
which contains one or more uniqueMember
attributes. In a dynamic group configuration, each user entry in
LDAP contains an attribute which lists group
membership.

|Base DN|

This field is similar to the Base DN field described in
<xref linkend="tbl-ldap-user-element-config"
xrefstyle="select: label" />. This field is visible if Static
Groups is selected. If your groups were defined under
"ou=groups,dc=sonatype,dc=com", this field
would have a value of "ou=groups

|Group Subtree|

This field is similar to the User Subtree field described
in <xref linkend="tbl-ldap-user-element-config"
xrefstyle="select: label" />. If all groups are defined under the
entry defined in Base DN, this field should be false, if a group
can be defined in a tree of organizational units under the Base
DN, this field should be true. This field is visible if Static
Groups is selected.

|Object Class|

This value defaults to
groupOfUniqueNames which is a standard
object class defined in <ulink
url="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2798.html">RFC 4519.
groupOfUniqueNames is simply a collection
of references to unique entries in an LDAP directory and can be
used to associate user entries with a group. Other possible values
are posixGroup or a custom class. This
field is visible if Static Groups is selected.

|Group ID Attribute|

Specifies the attribute of the Object class which specifies
the Group ID. If the value of this field corresponds to the ID of
a Nexus Role, members of this group will have the corresponding
Nexus privileges. Defaults to "cn". This field
is visible if Static Groups is selected.

|Group Member Attribute|

Specifies the attribute of the Object class which specifies
a member of a group. A groupOfUniqueNames
has multiple uniqueMember attributes for
each member of a group. Defaults to
"uniqueMember". This field is visible if Static
Groups is selected.

|Group Member Format|

This field captures the format of the Group Member
Attribute and it is used by Nexus to extract a username from this
attribute. For example, if the Group Member Attribute has the
format "uid=brian,ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com",
then the Group Member Format would be
"uid=\${username},ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com".
If the Group Member Attribute had the format
"brian", then the Group Member Format would be
"\${username}". This field is visible if Static
Groups is selected.

|Member of Attribute|

When Dynamic Groups is selected, Nexus will inspect an
attribute of the user entry to get a list of groups that the user
is a member of. In this configuration, a user entry would have an
attribute such as memberOf which would contain
the name of a group. This field is visible if Dynamic Groups is
selected.
|====

If your installation does not use
Static Groups, you can configure Nexus LDAP Integration
to refer to an attribute on the User entry to derive group membership. To
do this, select Dynamic Groups in the Group Type field in Group Element
Mapping. Selecting Dynamic Groups will show a single field named Member of
Attribute as shown in <xref linkend="fig-ldap-dynamic-groups"
xrefstyle="select: label" />.

[[fig-ldap-dynamic-groups]]

[[ldap-sect-mapping-active-directory]]
=== Mapping Users and Groups with Active Directory

When mapping users and groups to an Active Directory
installation, try the common configuration values listed in <xref

[[ldap-sect-mapping-roles-ldap]]
===Mapping Roles to LDAP Users

Once User and Group Mapping has been configured, you can start
verifying how LDAP users and groups are mapped to Nexus Roles. If a
user is a member of an LDAP group that has a Group ID corresponding to
the ID of a Nexus Role, that user is granted the appropriate
permissions in Nexus. For example, if the LDAP user entry in
"uid=brian,ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com" is a member of a
groupOfUniqueNames attribute value of admin, when this user logs into
Nexus, it will be granted the Nexus Administrator Role if Group
Element Mapping is configured properly. To verify the User Element
Mapping and Group Element Mapping, click on Check User Mapping in the
LDAP Configuration panel directly below the Group Element Mapping
section, <xref linkend="fig-ldap-verify-user-mapping"
xrefstyle="select: label" /> shows the results of this check.

[[fig-ldap-verify-user-mapping]] 
.Checking the User and Group Mapping in LDAP Configuration
image:figs/web/ldap_verifying_user_mapping.png[]

In <xref linkend="fig-ldap-verify-user-mapping" xrefstyle="select:
label" />, Nexus LDAP Integration locates a user with a User ID of
"brian" who is a member of the "admin" group. When brian logs in, he
will have all of the rights that the admin Nexus Role has.

[[ldap-sect-mapping-nexus-roles-ext]]
=== Mapping Nexus Roles for External Users

If you are unable to map all of the Nexus roles to LDAP groups, you
can always augment the Role information by adding a specific user-role
mapping for an external LDAP user in Nexus. In other words, if you
need to make sure that a specific user in LDAP gets a specific Nexus
role and you don't want to model this as a group membership, you can
add a role mapping for an external user in Nexus. Nexus will keep
track of this association independent of your LDAP server. Nexus
continues to delegate authentication to the LDAP server for this user,
Nexus will continue to map the user to Nexus roles based on the group
element mapping you have configured, but Nexus will also add any roles
specified in the User panel. You are augmenting the role information
that Nexus gathers from the group element mapping.

Once the User and Group Mapping has been configured, click on the
Users link under Security in the Nexus menu. The Users tab is going to
contain all of the "configured" users for this Nexus instance as shown
in <xref linkend="fig-ldap-all-configured-users-initial" />. A
configured user is a user in a Nexus-managed Realm or an External User
which has an explicit mapping to a Nexus role. In <xref
linkend="fig-ldap-all-configured-users-initial" />, you can see the
three default users in the Nexus-managed default realm plus the brian
user from LDAP. The brian user appears because this user has been
mapped to a Nexus role.

[[fig-ldap-all-configured-users-initial]] 
.Viewing All Configured Users
image:figs/web/ldap_ad_all_configured_users_initial.png[]

The list of users in <xref
linkend="fig-ldap-all-configured-users-initial" /> is a combination of
all of the users in the Nexus default realm and all of the External
Users with role mappings. To explore these two sets of users, click on
the All Configured Users dropdown and choose "Default Realm
Users". Once you select this, click in the search field and press
Enter. Searching with a blank string in the Users panel will return
all of the users of the selected type. In <xref
linkend="fig-ldap-all-default-realm" /> you see a dialog containing
all three default users from the Nexus default realm.

[[fig-ldap-all-default-realm]]
.All Default Realm Users
image:figs/web/ldap_ad_all_default_realm_users.png[]

If you wanted to see a list of all LDAP users, select "LDAP" from the
"All Configured Users" dropdown shown in <xref
linkend="fig-ldap-all-configured-users-initial" /> and click on the
search button (magnifying glass) with an empty search field. Clicking
search with an empty search field will return all of the LDAP users as
shown in <xref linkend="fig-ldap-all-ldap-realm" />.

NOTE: Note that the user "tobrien" does not show up in the "All
Configured Users" list. This is by design. Nexus is only going to show
you information about users with external role mappings. If an
organization has an LDAP directory with thousands of developers, Nexus
doesn't need to retain any configuration information for users that
don't have custom Nexus role mappings.

[[fig-ldap-all-ldap-realm]]
.All LDAP Users
image:figs/web/ldap_ad_all_ldap_realm_users.png[]

To add a mapping for an external LDAP user, you would click on the
"All Configured Users" dropdown and select LDAP. Once you've selected
LDAP, type in the user ID you are searching for and click the search
button (magnifying glass icon to right of the search field). In <xref
linkend="fig-ldap-search-ldap-users" />, a search for "brian" yields
one user from the LDAP server.

[[fig-ldap-search-ldap-users]]
.Search LDAP Users
image:figs/web/ldap_ad_searching_ldap_users.png[]

To add a Nexus role mapping for the external user "brian" shown in
<xref linkend="fig-ldap-search-ldap-users" />, click on the user in
the results table and drag a role from Available Roles to Selected
Roles as shown in <xref linkend="fig-ldap-mapping-deploy" />. In this
case, the user "brian" is mapped to the Administrative group by virtue
of his membership in an "admin" group in the LDAP server. In this use
case, a Nexus administrator would like to grant Brian the Deployment
Role without having to create a LDAP group for this role and modifying
his group memberships in LDAP

[[fig-ldap-mapping-deploy]] 
.Mapping the Deployment Role to an External User
image:figs/web/ldap_ad_mapping_ldap_deployment.png[]

The end result of this operation is to augment the Group-Role mapping
that is provided by the LDAP integration. You can use LDAP groups to
manage coarse-grained permissions to grant people administrative
privileges and developer roles, and if you need to perform more
targeted privilege assignments in Nexus you can Map LDAP users to
Nexus roles with the techniques shown in this section.

[[ldap-sect-external-role-mapping-config]]
=== Mapping External Roles to Nexus Roles

Nexus makes it very straightforward to map an external
role to an internal Nexus role. This is something you would do, if you
want to grant every member of an externally managed group (such as an
LDAP group) a certain privilege in Nexus. For example, assume that you
have a group in LDAP named "svn" and you want to make sure that everyone
in the "svn" group has Nexus Administrative privileges. To do this, you
would click on the Add.. dropdown in the Role panel as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-ldap-select-ext-role-map" />. This dropdown can be found in
the Role management panel which is opened by clicking on Roles in the
Security menu.

[[fig-ldap-select-ext-role-map]] 
.Selecting External Role Mapping in the Role Management Panel
image:figs/web/ldap_mapping-external-role.png[]

Selecting External Role Mapping under Add... will show you a dialog
which contains a dropdown of External Realms. Selecting an external
realm such as LDAP will then bring up a list of roles managed by that
external realm. The dialog shown in <xref
linkend="fig-ldap-select-ext-role" /> shows the external realm LDAP
selected and the role "svn" being selected to map to a Nexus role.

[[fig-ldap-select-ext-role]]
.Selecting an Externally Managed Role to Map to a Nexus Role
image:figs/web/ldap_mapping-external-role-select.png[]

Once the external role has been selected, Nexus will create a
corresponding Nexus Role. You can then assign other Roles to this new
externally mapped Role. <xref linkend="fig-ldap-external-role-config"
/> shows that the SVN role from LDAP is being assigned the Nexus
Administrator Role. This means that any user that is authenticated
against the external LDAP Realm who is a member of the svn LDAP group
will be assigned a Nexus role that maps to the Nexus Administrator
Role.

[[fig-ldap-external-role-config]]
.Mapping an External Role to a Nexus Role

[[ldap-sect-enterprise]]
=== Enterprise LDAP Support

The following sections outline Enterprise LDAP features which are
available in Nexus Professional.  <section> Enterprise LDAP Failover
Support When an LDAP server fails, the applications authenticating
against it can also become unavailable. Because a central LDAP server
is such a critical resource, many large software enterprises will
install a series of primary and secondary LDAP servers to make sure
that the organization can continue to operate in the case of an
unforeseen failure. Nexus Professional’s Enterprise LDAP plugin now
provides you with the ability to define multiple LDAP servers for
authentication. To configure multiple LDAP servers, click on
Enterprise LDAP under Security in the Nexus application menu. You
should see the Enterprise LDAP panel shown in the following figure.

.Defining Multiple LDAP Servers in Nexus Professional
image:figs/web/multiple-ldap-servers.png[]

You can use the Backup Mirror setting for an LDAP repository. This
backup mirror is another LDAP server which will be consulted if the
original LDAP server cannot be reached. Nexus Professional assumes
that the backup mirror is a carbon copy of the original LDAP server,
and it will use the same user and group mapping configuration as the
original LDAP server.  Instead of using the backup mirror settings,
you could also define multiple LDAP backup mirrors in the list of
configured LDAP servers shown in the previous figure. When you
configure more than one LDAP server, Nexus Professional will consult
the servers in the order they are listed in this panel. If Nexus can’t
authenticate against the first LDAP server, Nexus Professional will
move on to the next LDAP server until it either reaches the end of the
list or finds an LDAP server to authenticate against.  

.Use Multiple LDAP Servers in a Failover Scenario 
image:figs/web/ldap-backup.png[]

The feature just described is one way to increase the reliability of
your Nexus instance. In the previous case, both servers would have the
same user and group information. The secondary would be a mirror of
the primary. But, what if you wanted to connect to two LDAP servers
that contained different data? Nexus Professional also provides…

==== Support for Multiple Servers and LDAP Schemas

The same ability to list more than one LDAP server also allows you
to support multiple LDAP servers which may or may not contain the same
user authentication information. Assume that you had an LDAP server for
the larger organization which contained all of the user information
across all of the departments. Now assume that your own department
maintains a separate LDAP server which you use to supplement this larger
LDAP installation. Maybe your department needs to create new users that
are not a part of the larger organization, or maybe you have to support
the integration of two separate LDAP servers that use different schema
on each server.

A third possibility is that you need to support authentication
against different schema within the same LDAP server. This is a common
scenario for companies which have merged and whose infrastructures has
not yet been merged. To support multiple servers with different
user/group mappings or to support a single server with multiple
user/group mappings, you can configure these servers in the Enterprise
LDAP panel shown above. Nexus will iterate through each LDAP server
until it can successfully authenticate a user against an LDAP
server.

.Supporting Multiple LDAP Schemas with Nexus Professional
image:figs/web/ldap-multiple.png[]

==== Enterprise LDAP Performance Caching and Timeout

If you are constantly authenticating against a large LDAP server,
you may start to notice a significant performance degradation. With
Nexus Professional you can cache authentication information from LDAP.
To configure caching, create a new server in the Enterprise LDAP panel,
and scroll to the bottom of the Connect tab. You should see the
following input field which contains the number of seconds to cache the
results of LDAP queries.

.Setting the LDAP Query Cache Duration (in Seconds)
image:figs/web/ldap-caching.png[]

You will also see options to alter the connection timeout and
retry interval for an LDAP server. If you are configuring a number of
different LDAP servers with different user and group mappings, you will
want to make sure that you’ve configured low timeouts for LDAP servers
at the beginning of your Enterprise LDAP server list. If you do this
properly, it will take Nexus next to no time to iterate through the list
of configured LDAP servers.

.Setting the LDAP Connection Timeout (in Seconds)
image:figs/web/ldap-timeout.png[]

We improved the overall caching in this release. The cache duration is
configurable and applies to authentication and authorization, which
translates into pure speed! Once you’ve configured LDAP caching in
Nexus Professional, authentication and other operations that involve
permissions and credentials once retrieved from an external server
will run in no time.

==== User and Group Templates

If you are configuring your Nexus Professional instance to connect
to an LDAP server there is a very good chance that your server follows
one of several, well-established standards. Nexus Professional’s LDAP
server configuration includes these widely used user and group mapping
templates which great simplify the setup and configuration of a new LDAP
server. To configure user and group mapping using a template, select a
LDAP server from the Enterprise LDAP panel, and choose the User and
Group Settings. You will see a User &amp; Group Templates section as
shown in the following figure.

.Using User &amp; Group Mapping Templates
image:figs/web/ldap-templates.png[]

==== Testing a User Login

Nexus Professional provides you with the ability to test a user
login directly. To test a user login, go to the User and Group Settings
tab for a server listed in the Enterprise LDAP panel. Scroll to the
bottom of the form, and you should see a button named “Check
Login”.

.Testing a User Login
image:figs/web/ldap-check-login.png[]

If you click on Check Login, you will then be presented with the
login credentials dialog shown below. You can use this dialog to login
as an LDAP user and test the user and group mapping configuration for a
particular server. This feature allows you to test user and group
mapping configuration directly. This feature allows you to quickly
diagnose and address difficult authentication and access control issues
via the administrative interface.
