== Nexus Atlassian Crowd Plugin

Atlassian's Crowd is a single sign-on and identity management product
that many organizations use to consolidate user accounts and control
which users and groups have access to which applications. Nexus
Professional contains an optional security plugin that allows you to
configure Nexus to authenticate against an Atlassian Crowd
instance. For more information about Atlassian Crowd, go to
http://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd/

=== Installing the Crowd Plugin

When you downloaded Nexus Professional, you also download a few
optional plugins including the Nexus Crowd plugin. This plugin is
located in the ${NEXUS_HOME}/runtime/apps/nexus/optional-plugins
directory under <filename>security-crowd-realm-${nexus.version}. To
install this plugin in Nexus:

* Copy the security-crowd-realm-${nexus.version}/ directory from
\${NEXUS_HOME}/runtime/apps/nexus/optional-plugins to
\${SONATYPE_WORK}/nexus/plugin-repository

* Once the optional User Account plugin has been copied to the
plugin-repository/ directory, restart Nexus and the User Account
plugin will be installed.

=== Configuring the Crowd Plugin

Once the Atlassian Crowd plugin is installed, restart Nexus
and login as a user with Administrative privileges. To configure the Crowd
plugin, click on the Crowd Configuration in the Security section of the
Nexus menu as shown in <xref linkend="fig-crowd-menu-link" />.

[[fig-crowd-menu-link]]

Clicking on the Crowd Configuration link will load the form shown in
<xref linkend="fig-crowd-config" />. This configuration panel contains
all of the options that need to be configured to connect your Nexus
instance to Crowd for authorization and authentication.

The following sections outline all of the settings in the Crowd
Configuration Pane.

=== Crowd Access Settings

The Access Settings section of the Crowd configuration is shown in
<xref linkend="fig-crowd-access-settings" />. This section contains
the following fields:

Application Name:: This field contains the application name of a Crowd
application. This value should match the value in the Name field of
the form shown in <xref linkend="fig-crowd-app" />.

Application Password:: This field contains the application password of
a Crowd application. This value should match the value in the Password
field of the form shown in <xref linkend="fig-crowd-app" />.

Crowd Server URL:: This is the URL of the Crowd Server, this URL
should be accessible to the Nexus process as it is the URL that Nexus
will use to connect to Crowd's SOAP services.

Authentication Interval:: This is the number of minutes that a Crowd
authentication is valid for. This value is in units of minutes, and a
value of 30 means that Nexus will only require reauthentication if
more than 30 minutes have elapsed since a previously authenticated
user has accessed Nexus.

Use Groups:: If clicked, Use Groups allows Nexus to use Crowd Groups
when calculating Nexus Roles. When selected, you can map a Nexus Role
to a Crowd Group.

==== Crowd HTTP Settings

You can control the concurrency of connections to Crowd in the HTTP
Settings section shown in <xref linkend="fig-crowd-http-settings"
/>. If you have a high-traffic instance of Nexus, you will want to
limit the number of simultaneous connections to the Crowd server to a
reasonable value like 20. The HTTP Timeout specifies the number of
milliseconds Nexus will wait for a response from Crowd. A value of
zero for either of these properties indicates that there is no limit
to either the number of connections or the timeout.

==== Crowd HTTP Proxy Settings

If your Nexus installation is connecting to Crowd via an HTTP Proxy
server, the HTTP Proxy Settings section of the Crowd Configuration
allows you to specify the host, port, and credentials for a HTTP Proxy
server. The HTTP Proxy Settings section is shown in <xref
linkend="fig-crowd-http-proxy" />.

==== Miscellaneous Settings

The miscellaneous settings section shown in <xref
linkend="fig-crowd-misc-settings" />, allows you to configure settings
that control the name of the Single Sign-on cookie and the various
keys that are used to retrieve values that relate to authentication
and the auth token. This dialog is only relevant if you have modified
optional Crowd settings in your
\${CROWD_HOME}/etc/crowd.properties. For more information about
customizing these options see the http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/The+crowd.properties+File[Atlassian
Crowd documentation]

=== Adding the Crowd Authentication Realm

Once you have configured Nexus to connect to Crowd, you must select
the Crowd authorization realm from the list of available realms in
your Nexus Server settings. <xref linkend="fig-crowd-activate-realm"
/>, shows the Security settings section in the Nexus Server
configuration. To load the Nexus server configuration panel, click on

=== Configuring a Nexus Application in Crowd

To connect Nexus to Atlassian's Crowd, you will need to configure
Nexus as an application in Crowd. To do this, login to Crowd as a user
with Administrative rights, and click on the Applications tab. Once
you click on this tab, you should see two options under the
Applications tab: Search Applications and Add Application. Click on
Add Application to display the form shown in <xref
linkend="fig-crowd-app" />, and create a new application with the
following values in the Details tab of the Add Application form:

* Application Type: Generic Application

* Name: nexus

* Description: Sonatype Nexus Professional

Choose a password for this application. Nexus will use this password
to authenticate with the Crowd server. Click on the Next button.

[[fig-crowd-app]]
.Creating a Nexus Crowd Application

Clicking on Next will advance the form to the Connection tab shown in
<xref linkend="fig-crowd-app-connection" />. In this tab you need to
supply the URL Nexus and the remote IP address for Nexus. <xref
linkend="fig-crowd-app-connection" />, shows the Connection form
configured for a local instance of Nexus. If you were configuring
Crowd and Nexus in a production environment, you would supply the URL
that users would use to load Nexus in a web browser and you would
supply the IP address that Nexus will be connecting from. Once you
have completed the Connection form, click on Next to advance to the
Directories form.

[[fig-crowd-app-connection]]

Clicking on Next advances to the Directories form shown in <xref
linkend="fig-crowd-app-directories" />. In this example, the Nexus
application in Crowd is going to use the default "User Management"
directory. Click on the Next button to advance to the "Authorisation"
form.

[[fig-crowd-app-directories]]

image:figs/web/crowd_new-app-directories.png[]

Clicking on the Next button advances to the "Authorisation" form shown
in <xref linkend="fig-crowd-app-authorization" />. If any of the
directories selected in the previous form contain groups, each group
is displayed on this form next to a checkbox. You can select "Allow
all users" for a directory, or you can select specific groups which
are allowed to authenticate to Crowd through Nexus. This option would
be used if you wanted to limit Nexus access to specific subgroups
within a larger Crowd directory. If your entire organization is stored
in a single Crowd directory, you may want to limit Nexus access to a
group that contains only Developers and Administrators.
