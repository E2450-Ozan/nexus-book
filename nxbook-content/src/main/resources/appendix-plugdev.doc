== Developing Nexus Plugins

Among the many benefits of using an technology with an open source
core is the ability to customize behavior and create extensions. To
this end, Sonatype has spent a great deal of time designing an
intuitive Plugin API that will allow you to take Nexus where you need
it to go. This chapter summarizes some of these extension points and
presents a walk through of how you would start to develop your own
Nexus plugins.

Our community has already created a number of compelling and useful
plugins, some of which have been integrated into the set of plugins
that are distributed with both Nexus Open Source and Nexus
Professional. Sonatype tried to make the Plugin API as lightweight and
extensible as possible with the following goals in mind:

* Providing a clear set of extension points for plugin developers

* Providing isolated plugin classpaths to avoid compatibility issues
between plugins and to prevent a plugin from disturbing another,
unrelated part of Nexus.

* Giving developers the ability to load and unload Nexus plugins at
runtime

=== Nexus Plugins

The Nexus API is contained in a module named nexus-api. If you are
developing a Nexus plugin, you will need to familiarize yourself with
the extension points that are defined in this project.

==== Nexus Plugin API

Nexus provides an extra module for plugin developers - the
"nexus-plugin-api". This module provides some extra annotations for
plugins developers, and it allows a plugin developer to implement a
plugin without having to know anything about Plexus or Nexus
internals.

The Plugin API uses the @Inject annotation, an emerging standard for
dependency injection which allows Nexus plugins to be developed in a
way that is container-neutral.

The Nexus Plugin API introduces some annotations to make things
easier:

----
@Managed
----

When a @Managed annotation is present on an interface, it marks
the interface as "component contract" (Plexus role). Any non-abstract
classes implementing it will be made managed by current
container.

----
@RepositoryType
----

Used on interfaces, to mark it as new repository type, and to be
registered with other core repository types in Nexus Repository Type
Registry. It holds the basic information about the new type (the path
where to mount it).

----
@RestResource
----

Used on classes, to mark them as REST Resources.


[[plugdev-sect-ext-points]]
=== Nexus Extension Points

The simplest Nexus plugin contain a single class,
SampleEventInjector, which contributes an EventInspector to Nexus
Application. This simple event inspector will do nothing more than print
a message every time it accepts and inspects an event.

.A Simple Event Inspector
----
package org.sample.plugin;

import javax.inject.Inject;

import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.events.EventInspector;
import org.sonatype.plexus.appevents.Event;

public class SampleEventInspector implements EventInspector {
  public boolean accepts( Event&lt;?> evt ) {
    return true;
  }

  public void inspect( Event&lt;?> evt ) {
    System.out.println( "invoked with event: " + 
                        evt.toString() + " with sender " + 
                        evt.getEventSender().toString() );
  }
}
----

During the build of this nexus plugin, this class is compiled and then
scanned for concrete classes that implement extension point interfaces
defined in the following section. The EventInspector interface in the
nexus-api project has been marked with the @ExtensionPoint
annotation. The plugin build takes the @ExtensionPoint, @Named, and
@Inject annotations that may be present and generates a plugin
descriptor which is packaged in the plugin's JAR.

When the plugin is present in Nexus during startup, the Nexus plugin
manager reads the plugin metadata and instantiates the appropriate
components. To implement a plugin, you simply implement some of these
interfaces.

=== Nexus Plugin Extension Points

The following sections outline the available Nexus
extension points.

=== Nexus Plugin Extension

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.plugins.NexusPlugin

This extension component is meant to be used in Nexus plugins
only. If it is found in a plugin, it will be invoked during
install/uninstall/init phases of a plugin
installation/uninstallation/initialization. Typical usage would be a
need to perform some specific tasks on plugin install (ie. it uses
native code to do some magic and those needs to be copied somewhere,
register them with OS, etc).

=== Nexus Index HTML Customizer

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.plugins.rest.NexusIndexHtmlCustomizer

This extension is able to customize the "index.html" returned by
Nexus. Using this component, a plugin is able to add markup or
Javascript to the pages generated by the Nexus web application. Every
plugin that has a UI component uses this extension point to add
Javascript customizations to the interface.

=== Static Plugin Resources

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.plugins.rest.NexusResourceBundle

This extension gathers and publishes static resources over HTTP.
These resources are usually JS files, CSS files, images, etc. Plugin
developers do not need to use this extension directly since some of
the features it exposes are automatic for all plugins. When the Nexus
plugin manager discovers resources in plugin JAR under the path
"/static", the Plugin Manager will create a special "plugin
NexusResourceBundle" component on the fly.

If you do not want the plugin manager to automatically add a
resource bundle you can define your own resource bundle
implementation. The plugin manager will not add a resource bundle
if:

* no resources found on "/static" path within plugin classpath, or

* a user created component of NexusResourceBundle exists within plugin

The "default plugin" resource bundle component uses MimeUtil from core
to select MIME types of resources found within plugin, and will use
same path to publish them (ie. in plugin JAR "/static/image.png" will
be published on "http://nexushost/nexus/static/image.png").

=== Plugin Templates

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.templates.TemplateProvider

Template provider is a component providing repository templates to
Nexus. Every plugin which provides a "new" repository type should add
a TemplateProvider as it is the only way to instantiate a repository
instance. The core of Nexus provides a "default" template provider
with templates for all core repository types, and all custom
repository plugins (P2, OBR) provide template providers for their
types.

=== Event Inspectors

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.events.EventInspector

Event inspectors are used to inspect events in Nexus. One
example of where this extension point is used is the index generation.
To generate a Nexus index, there is an event inspector which listens
for RepositoryItemEvent subclasses and updates the index in response
to repository activity.

=== Content Generators

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.item.ContentGenerator

A content generator is a component that is able to generate
content dynamically, on the fly, instead of just serving a static
resource. The content generator is registered to respond to a path
that corresponds to a file. When the resource is retrieved, Nexus
discards the file content and uses the registered content generator to
generate content. The Nexus Archetype plugin uses a content generator
to generate the archetype-catalog.xml. Every time a client requests
the archetype-catalog.xml, the archetype catalog is generated using
information from the index.

=== Content Classes

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.registry.ContentClass

Content class controls the compatibility between repository
types. It defines the type of content that can be stored in a
repository, and it also affects how repositories can be grouped into
repository groups. Every plugin contributing a new repository type
should provide an instance of this extension point. Nexus has a
ContentClass implementation for every core supported repository type,
and the P2 and OBR plugins define custom ContentClass
implementations.

=== Storage Implementations

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.storage.local.LocalRepositoryStorage

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.storage.remote.RemoteRepositoryStorage

A plugin developer can override the default file-based local
repository storage and the default remote HTTP repository storage
interface. If your plugin needs to stores repository artifacts and
information in something other than a filesystem, or if your remote
repository isn't accessible via HTTP, your plugin would provide an
implementation of one of these interfaces. Nexus provides one of the
each: a file-system LocalRepositoryStorage and CommonsHttpClient 3.x
based RemoteRepositoryStorage.

=== Repository Customization

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.plugins.RepositoryCustomizer

This extension component will be invoked during configuration of
every Repository instance, and may be used to add some "extra"
configuration to repositories The procurement plugin uses this
mechanism to "inject" RequestProcessor that will evaluate rules before
allowing execution of request.

=== Item and File Inspectors

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.attributes.StorageItemInspector

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.attributes.StorageFileItemInspector

Attribute storage ItemInspectors are able to "decorate" items in
repositories with custom attributes. Every file stored/cached/uploaded
in Nexus will be sent to these components for inspection and
potentially decoration. The StorageItemInspector will get all item
types for inspection (file, collections, links), while
StorageFileItemInspector will get only file items. Currently only one
ItemInspector is used in Nexus: the checksumming inspector, that
decorates all file items in Nexus with SHA1 checksum and stores it
into item attributes.

=== Nexus Feeds

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.rest.feeds.sources.FeedSource

To add new RSS feeds, a plugin may provide implementation of this
extension point. Nexus provides implementation for all the "core" RSS
feeds.

=== Nexus Tasks and Task Configuration

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.scheduling.NexusTask&lt;T>

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.tasks.descriptors.ScheduledTaskDescriptor

NexusTask is an extension point to implement new Nexus Scheduled
Tasks.

If a contributed task needs UI, then the plugin which provides the
NexusTask should provide a ScheduledTaskDescriptor which allows the UI
customization for the task creation and management interface.

=== Application Customization

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.rest.NexusApplicationCustomizer

This extension component is able to intercept URLs routed in the
Nexus REST API layer.

=== Request Processing

Interface: org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.repository.RequestProcessor

This extension point can affect how a repository reacts to an item
request.

[[plugdev-sect-archetype]]
=== Using the Nexus Plugin Archetype

To create a new Nexus Plugin, you can use the Nexus Plugin Archetype
by running archetype:generate with the following identifiers:

archetypeGroupId:: org.sonatype.nexus.archetypes
archetypeArtifactId:: nexus-plugin-archetype
archetypeVersion:: 1.2

Once you run archetype:generate, you will be prompted for the groupId,
artifactId, version, and package name for the generated project.

Once the Archetype plugin has created the project, you will have a
project with the layout shown in <xref
linkend="fig-plugdev-project-layout" />.

[[fig-plugdev-project-layout]]
.Layout of a Nexus Plugin Project
image:figs/web/plugdev_filesystem.png[]

The generated project contains the following classes:

org.sonatype.book.nexus.XYVirusScanner:: An implementation of the
VirusScanner Interface

org.sonatype.book.nexus.VirusScannerRequestProcessor:: A class which
customizes the request handling process in Nexus

org.sonatype.book.nexus.VirusScannerRepositoryCustomizer:: A class
which customizes the repositories affected by the VirusScanner

org.sonatype.book.nexus.VirusScanner:: A VirusScanner interface
described in <xref linkend="plugdev-sect-complex" />.

org.sonatype.book.nexus.events.InfectedItemFoundEvent:: A simple event
which is fired by the VirusScanner

[[plugdev-sect-target-version]]
=== Set the Target Nexus Version

To set the target Nexus version of the new Nexus Plugin project, you
will need to edit this new project's POM. Open up the POM of your
Nexus Plugin and find the section that defines properties. You will
need to change the nexus-version property to target a Nexus
version. After creating a project with the Nexus Plugin archetype, you
will see a properties section of the POM that contains a
${nexusVersion}

----
<project>
  ...
  <properties>
    <!-- Set the Nexus version here, against which you build the plugin -->
    <nexus-version>${nexusVersion}</nexus-version>
  </properties>
  ...
</project>
----

To target a version of Nexus, change ${nexusVersion} to a Nexus
version number. The following program listing shows a properties
section in the generated POM which targets version 1.4.1 of Nexus.

----
<project>
  ...
  <properties>
    <!-- Set the Nexus version here, against which you build the plugin -->
    <nexus-version>1.4.1</nexus-version>
  </properties>
  ...
</project>
----

[[plugdev-sect-building]]
=== Building a Nexus Plugin Project

To build your Nexus plugin project, just run mvn install in the newly
generated project directory. Once the build is completed, your
plugin's JAR will be available in the project's target/

The Nexus Plugin project, as created by the Nexus Plugin archetype,
depends on a number of artifacts which may not be available from the
Maven Central repository. If you experience missing artifacts during
your Nexus plugin project build, you should make sure that the
following repositories are added to your environment:

* The Sonatype Forge Repository:
  http://repository.sonatype.org/content/groups/forge

* The Codehaus Snapshot Repository:
  http://snapshots.repository.codehaus.org

If you experience any difficulty with the build, you may also want to
remove the section of the generated POM that is labeled with the
#ITSet label.

If you are using Nexus, and you have configured your build to work
against a public group, you will want to make sure that you have added
both of the repositories listed above to your public group. You will
also want to make sure that the Repository Policy setting for the
Sonatype Forge Repository is set to "Release".

[[plugdev-sect-complex]]
=== Creating a Complex Plugin

In this section, we will step through a skeletal, sample project that
implements a virus scanner plugin for Nexus. This plugin will consist
of:

* A managed "virus scanner" component

* A RequestProcessor that sends all "incoming" artifacts for scanning

* A repository customizer to inject a RequestProcessor to all proxy
  repositories

We start with creating a @Managed component contract for the
VirusScanner. While this class could just as easily be a non-managed
component, this example uses the @Managed and @Singleton annotations
to demonstrate dependency injection.

.VirusScanner Interface
----
package org.sonatype.book.nexus;

import javax.inject.Singleton;

import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.item.StorageFileItem;
import org.sonatype.plugin.Managed;

@Managed
@Singleton
public interface VirusScanner
{
  boolean hasVirus( StorageFileItem file );
}
----

Once we have the interface for VirusScanner, we need to define a named
instance XYVirusScanner which implements the interface. The following
example shows how the @Named annotation is used to assign a name of
"XY" to this implementation.

.XYVirusScanner Implementation
----
package org.sonatype.book.nexus;

import javax.inject.Named;

import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.item.StorageFileItem;

@Named( "XY" )
public class XYVirusScanner implements VirusScanner {

  public boolean hasVirus( StorageFileItem file ) {

    // DO THE JOB HERE
    System.out.println( "Kung fu VirusScanner --- " +
          "scanning for viruses on item: " + file.getPath() );

    // simulating virus hit by having the filename 
    // contain the "infected" string
    return file.getName().contains( "infected" );
  }

}
----

The next class is a request processor which virus scans an artifact
before it is cached locally. If a virus is found in an artifact, this
plugin will refuse to cache the artifact and trigger an event which
will signal that a virus was found in a file item. Note the use of
@Named which assigns the name "virusScanner" to this component. Also
note the two uses of @Inject. The first use of @Inject will fetch the
default implementation of ApplicationEventMulticaster, and the second
use of @Inject will fetch the "XY" virus scanner.

.Virus Scanning Request Processor
----
package org.sonatype.book.nexus;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.inject.Named;

import org.sonatype.book.nexus.events.InfectedItemFoundEvent;
import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.ResourceStoreRequest;
import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.access.Action;
import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.item.AbstractStorageItem;
import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.item.StorageFileItem;
import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.repository.ProxyRepository;
import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.repository.Repository;
import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.repository.RequestProcessor;
import org.sonatype.plexus.appevents.ApplicationEventMulticaster;

@Named( "virusScanner" )
public class VirusScannerRequestProcessor
implements RequestProcessor {

  @Inject
  private ApplicationEventMulticaster applicationEventMulticaster;

  @Inject
  private @Named( "XY" )
  VirusScanner virusScanner;

  // @Inject
  // private @Named("A") CommonDependency commonDependency;

  public boolean process( Repository repository, 
                     ResourceStoreRequest request, Action action )
  {
    // Check dependency
    // System.out.println( "VirusScannerRequestProcessor " + 
               "--- CommonDependency data: " + 
               commonDependency.getData()
    // );

    // don't decide until have content
    return true;
  }

  public boolean shouldProxy( ProxyRepository repository, 
                  ResourceStoreRequest request )
  {
    // don't decide until have content
    return true;
  }

  public boolean shouldCache( ProxyRepository repository, 
                  AbstractStorageItem item )
  {
    if ( item instanceof StorageFileItem ) {
      StorageFileItem file = (StorageFileItem) item;

      // do a virus scan
      boolean hasVirus = virusScanner.hasVirus( file );

      if ( hasVirus ) {
        applicationEventMulticaster
            .notifyEventListeners( 
                new InfectedItemFoundEvent( item
                    .getRepositoryItemUid().getRepository(), 
                       file ) );
      }

      return !hasVirus;
    } else {
      return true;
    }
  }
}
----

The last extension is RepositoryCustomizer, that simply injects our
virus scanner RequestProcessor into proxy repositories only (the only
way to get an artifact into Nexus from uncontrolled Internet. Local
uploads are considered "safe" for this example). Note how the request
processor is injected into this repository customizer with @Inject and
@Named.

.The Virus Scanner Repository Customizer
----
package org.sonatype.book.nexus;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.inject.Named;

import org.sonatype.configuration.ConfigurationException;
import org.sonatype.nexus.plugins.RepositoryCustomizer;
import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.repository.ProxyRepository;
import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.repository.Repository;
import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.repository.RequestProcessor;

public class VirusScannerRepositoryCustomizer
     implements RepositoryCustomizer {

  @Inject
  private @Named( "virusScanner" )
  RequestProcessor virusScannerRequestProcessor;

  public boolean isHandledRepository( Repository repository ) {
    // handle proxy reposes only
    return repository.getRepositoryKind()
                  .isFacetAvailable( ProxyRepository.class );
  }

  public void configureRepository( Repository repository )
    throws ConfigurationException {
    repository.getRequestProcessors()
          .put( "virusScanner", 
                virusScannerRequestProcessor );
  }

}
----

=== Nexus Plugin Descriptor Maven Plugin

Nexus plugins have a custom packaging "nexus-plugin" which is
introduced by the NexusPD Maven Plugin. A "nexus-plugin" packaged
plugin:

* is a plain JAR
* has a META-INF/nexus/plugin.xml embedded Nexus Plugin Metadata embedded
* has static resources embedded into the plugin JAR

The NexusPD Maven plugin introduces a new project path (ie.
src/main/static-resources). Static resources such as JS files, images,
and CSS which are referenced in

[[plugdev-sect-plugin-descriptor]]
=== The Nexus Plugin Descriptor

Every Nexus plugin has a plugin descriptor which is generated during
the build process for a plugin. This plugin descriptor is packaged
with the plugin JAR and can be found in
${basedir}/target/classes/META-INF/nexus/plugin.xml

.A Nexus Plugin Descriptor
----
<plugin>
  <modelVersion>1.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>org.sonatype.sample</groupId>
  <artifactId>sample-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <name>Nexus Plugin Archetype</name>
  <applicationId>nexus</applicationId>
  <applicationEdition>OSS</applicationEdition>
  <applicationMinVersion>1.4.0</applicationMinVersion>
</plugin>
----

If your Nexus plugin has any dependencies, they will be included in
this plugin descriptor automatically. For example, if the Nexus plugin
you were developing had a dependency on commons-beanutils version
1.8.2, your plugin descriptor will incude the following
classpathDependency

----
<plugin>
  <modelVersion>1.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>org.sonatype.book.nexus</groupId>
  <artifactId>sample-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <name>Nexus Plugin Archetype</name>
  <applicationId>nexus</applicationId>
  <applicationEdition>OSS</applicationEdition>
  <applicationMinVersion>1.4.0</applicationMinVersion>
  <classpathDependencies>
    <classpathDependency>
      <groupId>commons-beanutils</groupId>
      <artifactId>commons-beanutils</artifactId>
      <version>1.8.2</version>
      <type>jar</type>
    </classpathDependency>
  </classpathDependencies>
</plugin>
----

=== Defining Custom Repository Types

When you need to introduce a custom repository type, you should
implement the Repository interface. The following example extends the
HostedRepository class and adds a repository type with the path prefix
"sample".

.Creating a Custom Repository Type Interface
----
package org.sample.plugin;

import org.sonatype.nexus.plugins.RepositoryType;
import org.sonatype.nexus.proxy.repository.HostedRepository;

@RepositoryType( pathPrefix="sample" )
public interface SampleRepository extends HostedRepository {
  String boo();
}
----

If you want to implement a custom repository type, you should
reference the nexus-proxy module as dependency which contains the
AbstractRepository class which is a useful superclass for repository
implementations. To implement the SampleRepository interface, you can
then extend the AbstractRepository as shown in the following example.

.Creating a Custom Repository Type Implementation
----
package org.sample.plugin;

public class DefaultSampleRepository extends AbstractRepository
    implements SampleRepository {

  .... implement it

}
----

Your newly introduced repository type will appear under
http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/sample/.
