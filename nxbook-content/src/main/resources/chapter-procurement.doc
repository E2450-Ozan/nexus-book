== Nexus Procurement Suite


[[procure-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

Nexus Procurement Suite provides an organization with control over
what artifacts are allowed into a repository from an external, proxied
repository such as the Maven Central Repository. Such control can be a
prerequisite for organizations unwilling or unable to trust the entire
contents of an external public repository. If an organization is
developing mission critical code, they will likely want to subject
every third party dependency to intense scrutiny and testing before
making an artifact available to build a release or support a team of
developers. In most Enterprise development environments, a developer
can't just decide to add in a new dependency to Hibernate or to the
Spring Framework on a whim; the decision to add dependencies to
third-party libraries will need to be funneled through an oversight
process that relies on an architect or an administrator to promote
artifacts to a certified release repository.

Another, more common experience is an organization which needs to
proxy something like the Maven Central Repository but wants to limit
access to specific versions of artifacts or prevent dependencies on
everything contained under a specific group. Some organizations are
more amenable to trusting the contents of a remote, proxied repository
like Central, but they also need the ability to block certain
dependencies.  Maybe you work on a team that needs to limit access to
dependencies with a certain license, or maybe you just want to make
sure no one uses a problematic version of Hibernate with a known bug?
The procurement suite is the tool that provides for both coarse and
fine-grained control of the artifacts that can appear in a repository.

[[procure-sect-stages]] 
=== The Stages of Procurement

A procured repository is a Hosted Repository which procures artifacts
from a Proxy Repository. For example, one could create a hosted
repository named "Secured Maven Central" and then configure this
hosted repository to procure artifacts from the "Maven Central"
repository. Once the hosted repository has been created and the source
of procurement has been configured, the repository will obtain
artifacts from the proxy repository as long as procurement is
activated.  If you start procurement for a Hosted repository, the
hosted repository will fetch artifacts from the Proxy repository
specified in the procurement settings. If you stop procurement for a
Hosted Repository, no additional artifacts will be retrieved from the
Proxy repository specified in the procurement settings.

The ability to enable or disable procurement for a Hosted repository
comes in very handy when you want to "certify" a Hosted repository as
containing all of the artifacts (no more and no less) required for a
production build. You can start procurement, run a build which
triggers artifact procurement, and then stop procurement knowing that
the procured repository now contains all of the artifacts required for
building a specific project. Stopping procurement assures you that the
contents of the repository will not change if the third-party,
external proxied repository does. This is an extra level of assurance
that your release artifacts depend on a set of artifacts under your
complete control.  

[[procure-sect-approaches]]
=== Two Approaches to Procurement

There are two main use cases for the Procurement Suite. In the first
use case, the Procured Release Repository, the Procurement features of
Nexus Professional are used to create a procured release repository to
make sure that the organization has full control over the artifacts
that are making it into a production release. The other use case, the
Procured Development Repository, is for organizations that need more
upfront control over which artifacts are allowed during the
development of a project. The following sections describe these two
uses cases in more detail.  [[procure-sect-cert]] === Procured Release
Repository

The Procurement Suite can be used in two different ways.  In the
"Procured Release" mode, developers work with a proxied 3rd party
repository exactly as they would without the Procurement Suite.  When
a developer needs to add a dependency on a new artifact, Nexus will
retrieve the artifact from the third-party repository (like Central or
Apache Snapshots) and this artifact will be served to Maven via a
proxied Nexus repository. When a QA or Release engineer needs to build
a release or staging artifact, the Release or QA build would be
configured to execute against a procured repository. A procured
repository is one which only serves the artifacts which have been
explicitly approved using the Procurement Suite.

.Procurement to a Certified Release Repository

In this model, developers can add as many third-party dependencies as
they want, and it is the responsibility of the QA and Release
engineers to approve (or procure) artifacts from the Development
Repository to the QA/Release Repository. Developers can move forward,
adding dependencies freely from a third-party, proxied repository, but
once it is time to populate a Release repository, a Nexus
administrator can audit the required artifacts, create a hosted
repository, turn on procurement, populate the repository, and then
deactivate procurement. This has the effect of "locking down" the
artifacts that are involved in a production release.

[[procure-sect-dev]]
=== Procured Development Repository

There are some development environments which require even more
control over which artifacts can be used and referenced by
developers. In these situations, it might make sense to only allow
developers to work with a procured repository. In this mode, a
developer must ask a Nexus administrator for permission to add a
dependency on a particular third-party artifact. A Procurement Manager
would then have to approve the artifact, or group of artifacts so that
they would be made available to the developers. This is the
"ask-first" model for organizations that want to control which
artifacts make it into the development cycle.

.Procurement to a Certified Development Repository
image:figs/web/procurement_ask-first-procurement.png[]

This is a model common in industries that have strict oversight
requirements. More often than not, banks, hospitals, and government
agencies have fairly strict regulations on the software that can be
used by large development teams. With the Procured Development
Repository approach, an architecture group can have full control over
what artifacts can be referenced by a large development team.

[[procure-sect-install]]
=== Installing the Procurement Suite

If you installed Nexus Professional, the Nexus Procurement Suite is
already installed. Just start Nexus and look for the Artifact
Procurement option in the left-hand navigation menu of the Nexus
interface. If you see the Artifact Procurement link as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-procure-links" />, the Procurement Suite is available and
ready to be configured.

[[procure-sect-configure]]
=== Setting up a Procured Repository

This section will walk through the process of creating and configuring
a hosted repository named "Procured Central" which will be procured
from the "Maven Central" proxy repository. Setting up a procured
repository consists of the following steps:

* Enabling Remote Index Downloads for a Proxy Repository

* Creating a Hosted Repository to be Procured

* Configuring Procurement for the Hosted Repository

* Configuring Procurement Rules

Before configuring a procured repository, you need to make sure that
you have enabled Remote Index downloading for the proxied repository
that will serve as the source for your procured repository.

NOTE: If you are attempting to procure artifacts from a remote
repository which does not have a repository index, you can still use
the procurement suite. Without a remote repository index, you will
need to configure procurement rules manually without the benefit of
the already populated repository tree shown in <xref
linkend="procure-sect-config-rule" />.

[[procure-sect-enabled-remote]]
=== Enable Remote Index Downloads

When you configure procurement rules for a hosted repository, the
administrative interface displays the repository as a tree of groups
and artifacts populated from the Remote Repository's Nexus
Index. Nexus ships with a set of proxy repositories, but remote index
downloading is disabled by default. To use procurement, you will need
to tell Nexus to download the remote indexes for a proxy
repository. Click on "Repositories" under Views/Repositories in the
Nexus menu, then click on the Maven Central repository in the list of
repositories. Click on the Configuration tab, locate Download Remote
Indexes, and switch this option to "True" as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-procure-enabling-remote" />.

[[fig-procure-enabling-remote]]
.Enabling Remote Index Downloads for a Proxy Repository
image:figs/web/procure_central-download-remote-index.png[]

Click on the Save button in the dialog shown in <xref
linkend="fig-procure-enabling-remote" />. Right-click on the Index in
the Repositories list and select "Re-Index". Nexus will then download
the remote repository and recreate the index for any Repository Groups
that contain this proxied repository. Nexus may take a few minutes to
download the remote index for a large repository. Depending on your
connection to the Internet, this process can take anywhere from under
a minute to a few minutes. The size of the remote index for Maven
Central is on the order of 30 MB. To check on the status of the remote
index download, click on System Feeds under Views in the Nexus
menu. Click on the last feed to see a list of "System Changes in
Nexus". If you see a log entry like the one highlighted in <xref
linkend="fig-procure-system-feed" />, Nexus has successfully
downloaded the Remote Index from Maven Central.

[[procue-sect-create-hosted]]
=== Create a Hosted Repository

When you configure procurement you are establishing a relationship
between a Proxy repository and a Hosted repository. To create a Hosted
repository, select Repositories from the Administration section of the
Nexus menu, and click on the Add button selecting Hosted as shown in
<xref linkend="fig-procure-add-hosted" />.

[[fig-procure-add-hosted]]
.Adding a Hosted Repository
image:figs/web/procure_add-hosted.png[]

Selecting Hosted will then load the Repository Config form shown in
<xref linkend="fig-procure-add-secured" />. Create a repository with a
Repository ID of "secured" and a name of "Secured". Make the release
policy "Release". Click the <guibutton>Save button to create the new
Hosted Repository.

[[fig-procure-add-secured]]
.Adding the "Secured" Hosted Repository
image:figs/web/procure_after-add-secured.png[]
          
[[procure-sect-config-procure-hosted]]
=== Configuring Procurement for Hosted Repository

At this point, the list of Repositories will have a new Hosted
repository named "Secured". The next step is to start procurement for
the new Secured repository. When you do this, you are establishing a
relationship between the new Hosted repository and a Proxy repository.
In this case, we're configuring procurement for the Secured repository
and we're telling the Procurement Suite to procure artifacts from the
Maven Central proxy repository. To configure this relationship and to
start procurement, click on Artifact Procurement under the Enterprise
menu. In the Procurement panel, click on Add Procurement Repository as
shown in <xref linkend="fig-procure-starting-procurement" />.

[[fig-procure-starting-procurement]]
.Adding a Procured Repository
image:figs/web/procure_add-procured-repository.png[]

You will then be presented with the Start Procurement dialog as shown
in <xref linkend="fig-procure-start-procurement-dialog" />. Select the
"Maven Central" proxy repository from the list of available Source
repositories.

[[fig-procure-start-procurement-dialog]] .Configuring Procurement for
a Hosted Repository
image:figs/web/procure_configure-procurement-confirm.png[] Procurement
is now configured and started, if you are using an instance of Nexus
installed on localhost port 8081, you can configure your clients to
reference the new Secured repository at
http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/secured

By default, all artifacts are denied and without further customization
of the procurement rules no artifacts will be available in the new
Secured repository.

One interesting thing to note about the "Secured" repository is that
the Repository Type changed, once procurement was started. When
procurement is activate for a Hosted repository, the repository will
show up in the Nexus interface as a Proxy repository. Click refresh in
the Repositories list, and look at the Secured repository in the list
of repositories, you will see that the repository type column contains
"proxy" as shown in <xref linkend="fig-procure-hosted-now-proxy" />.
When procurement is started for a hosted repository it is effectively
a proxy repository, and when it is stopped it will revert back to
being a normal hosted repository.

[[fig-procure-hosted-now-proxy]]

[[procure-sect-creating-rules]]
=== Procured Repository Administration

Once you've defined the relationship between a Hosted repository and a
Proxy repository and you have started procurement, you can start
defining the rules which will control which artifacts are allowed in a
procured repository and which artifacts are denied. You can also start
and stop procurement. This section details some of the administration
panels and features which are available for a procured repository.

[[procure-sect-viewing]] 
=== Viewing the Procurement Management Interface

A procurement rule is a rule to allow or deny the procurement of a
group, artifact, or a collection of groups or artifacts. You load the
Artifact Procurement interface by selecting Artifact Procurement under
the Enterprise section of the Nexus menu.  Clicking on this link will
load a list of procured repositories.  Clicking on the repository will
load the entire repository in a tree as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-procure-repository-view" />. This section will illustrate
the steps required for blocking access to an entire artifact and then
selectively allowing access to a particular version of that same
artifact. This is a common use-case in organizations which want to
standardize on specific versions of a particular dependency.

NOTE: If you are attempting to procure artifacts from a remote
repository which does not have a repository index, you can still use
the procurement suite. Without a remote repository index, you will
need to configure procurement rules manually without the benefit of
the already populated repository tree shown in this section.

[[fig-procure-repository-view]]
.Viewing a Repository in the Artifact Procurement Interface
image:figs/web/procure_repository-view.png[]

The directory tree in <xref
linkend="fig-procure-repository-view" /> is the index of the proxy
repository from which artifacts are being procured.

[[procure-sect-config-rule]]
=== Configuring a Procurement Rule

To configure a procurement rule, right click on a folder in the
tree. <xref linkend="fig-procure-deny-group-all" /> displays the
procurement interface after right clicking on the jython artifact
folder. In this dialog, we are telling the procurement interface to
deny everything in the jython group and its sub-groups. If you attempt
to retrieve any version under the jython artifact after this rule is
created, the Procurement Suite will prevent access to this
artifact. For example, if you attempt to build a project that depends
on jython:jython:2.1, it will not be made available via the Secured
repository created in <xref linkend="procure-sect-configure" />.

[[fig-procure-deny-group-all]]
.Denying Procurement for Everything Under a Group
image:figs/web/procure_deny-all-jython.png[]

After denying access to the entire jython artifact, right-click on the
2.1 version folder under the jython artifact folder. Select "Exactly
the artifact" as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-procure-allowing-artifact" /> to allow for the
procurement of only the 2.1 version. This has the effect of creating a
specific rule which allows the procurement of a single version of the
jython:jython artifact.

[[fig-procure-allowing-artifact]]
.Allowing Access to a Single Artifact in a Denied Group
image:figs/web/procure_approve-artifact.png[]

After allowing this element, your procurement tree is going to contain
red and green markers on the affected folders as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-procure-composite-effects" />. While the jython artifact
folder has a red slash through it the 2.1 version folder has a green
check. You have configured the Procurement Suite to deny access to all
versions of the jython artifact except version 2.1.

[[fig-procure-composite-effects]]
.Viewing the Effect of Composite Procurement Rules on the Tree
image:figs/web/procure_only-one-jython.png[]

[[procure-sect-manage-rules]]
=== Managing Procurement Rules

Once you've created a set of procurement rules you are going to want
to know how to view the procurement rules which are applicable to a
particular node. Procurement rules will frequently overlap; for
example, in <xref linkend="procure-sect-creating-rules" />, there are
two rules: one rule applies to all of the versions (folder) below the
jython artifact folder, and the other rule applies to a particular
version directory. Since rules can overlap, Nexus provides a simple
way to list and manage the rules which apply to a specific node in the
directory tree. <xref linkend="fig-procure-composite-effects" /> shows
the resolved procurement rules after clicking on the Jython 2.1
version artifact from <xref linkend="procure-sect-configure" />.

[[fig-procure-effective]]
.Effective Procurement Rules for a Particular Node
image:figs/web/procure_effective-rules.png[]

This dialog gives the procurement administrator a fine-grained view
into the rules that apply to a particular node. From this dialog you
can remove rules which apply to a specific node.

[[procure-sect-stopping]]
=== Stopping Procurement

Some organizations may want to "lock down" the artifacts that a
release build can depend upon, and it is also a good idea to make sure
that your build isn't going to be affected by changes to a repository
not under you control. A procurement administrator might configure a
procured repository, start procurement, and run an enterprise build
against the repository to populate the procured, hosted repository
with all of the necessary artifacts. After this process, the
procurement administrator can stop procurement and continue to run the
same release build against the hosted repository which now contains
all of the procured artifacts.

To stop procurement, go to the Artifact Procurement management
interface by clicking on Artifact Procurement under the Enterprise
section of the Nexus menu. Right click on the repository and choose
Stop Procurement as shown in <xref linkend="fig-procure-stopping" />.

[[fig-procure-stopping]]
.Stopping Procurement for a Procured Repository
image:figs/web/procure_stop-procurement.png[]

After choosing Stop Procurement, you will then see a dialog confirming
your decision to stop procurement as shown in <xref
linkend="fig-procure-stop-confirm" />.

[[fig-procure-stop-confirm]]
.Stop Procurement Confirmation Dialog
image:figs/web/procure_stop-procurement-confirm.png[]

Once procurement is stopped, the Secure repository will revert back to
being a plain-old Hosted repository. You can validate this by looking
at the repository type in the list of repositories.
