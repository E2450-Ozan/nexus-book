  <title>Foreword: ${project.version}</title>

  <para>The book you are reading was originally a part of <ulink
  url="${maven.book.baseurl}">Maven: The Definitive Guide</ulink>. As Sonatype
  expanded our coverage of this chapter for the Nexus Professional release we
  decided to separate the Repository Management chapter into a stand-alone
  title. This book covers both Nexus Open Source and Nexus Professional, a
  product which brings full control and visibility to organizations which
  depend on Maven repositories to manage releases and distribute software. The
  major push of this specific revision is in the Procurement Suite, Staging
  Suite, and the LDAP integration. This version updates the LDAP
  chapter.</para>

  <para>We welcome your feedback, please do not hesitate to contact the
  Sonatype team with any questions or ideas you may have about the product.
  We're focused on making the adoption of Nexus Professional painless, and we
  are here to do anything we can to help speed up the learning curve
  associated with some of the more advanced and powerful features of Nexus
  Professional.</para>
