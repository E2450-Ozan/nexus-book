== Atlassian Crowd Support

{inrmonly}

http://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd/[Atlassian Crowd] is a single sign-on and identity management product that
many organizations use to consolidate user accounts and control which users and groups have access to which
applications. {nxrm} contains a security realm that allows you to configure the repository manager to authenticate
against an Atlassian Crowd instance.

The following steps are necessary to configure Crowd-based authentication:

. <<crowd-nexus-prepare,Prepare Nexus>>
. <<crowd-application-prepare,Prepare Atlassian Crowd>>
. <<crowd-configuration,Configure the Nexus Crowd Connection>>
. <<crowd-sect-mapping,Configure Nexus Crowd Security>>
. <<crowd-realm,Activate the Nexus Crowd Realm>>

[[crowd-nexus-prepare]]
=== Prepare {pro} for Atlassian Crowd

Atlassian Crowd support is an option feature preinstalled and ready to configure in {pro} 3.1+.

WARNING: *Using LDAP and Crowd Realms together in the repository manager may work, but this is not supported.* If
you already use LDAP support, we recommend adding your LDAP server as a Crowd directory accessible to the Crowd
'nexus' application instead of using both LDAP and Crowd realms in the repository manager.

[[crowd-application-prepare]]
=== Prepare Atlassian Crowd

[[crowd-compatibility]]
==== Compatibility

Always use the latest version of Crowd available at the time your version of {pro} was released. When upgrading to
a newer Crowd server, carefully review the Crowd server release notes for REST API backwards compatibility issues.

Crowd support in {pro} 2.1 and greater only works in Crowd versions (3.1+) that support the Crowd
REST API. Older versions use a deprecated SOAP-based API and are less reliable and performant.

Crowd support is actively tested with the highest available version of Crowd at the time {pro} is released.

==== Configure a {pro} Application in the Atlassian Crowd Server

NOTE: These instructions are a general guide to adding an
application to Crowd. For current detailed instructions, visit the
https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/Adding+an+Application[official
Crowd documentation].

To connect {pro} to Crowd, you will need to configure {pro} as an application in Crowd.

. Login to Crowd as a user with administrative rights.
. Click on the 'Applications' tab.
. Click 'Add application' to display the form and create a new application with the following values in the 
'Details' tab of the Add Application form:

* Application Type: Generic Application

* Name: nexus

* Description: {pro}

. Choose a password for this application. Nexus will use this password
to authenticate with the Crowd server. Confirm the password, then click the 'Next' button.

[[fig-crowd-add-application]]
.Add a Crowd Application

Click 'Next' to advance to the 'Connection' breadcrumb. On this screen you need to supply the URL of your 
application instance and the remote IP address for {pro}. It shows the Connection form 
configured for a local instance of {pro}. If you were configuring Crowd and {pro} in a production environment, 
you would supply the URL that users would use to load the repository manager user interface in a web browser and 
you would supply the IP address that the repository manager will be connecting from.  Once you have completed the 
'Connection' form, click on 'Next' to advance to the 'Directories' form.

The 'Directories' form allows you to select the user directory used
for Nexus authentication. In this example, the default 'User
Management' directory will be used.


Clicking on the 'Next' button in the 'Directories' form advances to the 'Authorisation' form. If any of the 
directories selected in the previous form contain groups, each group is displayed on this form next to a 
checkbox. You can select 'Allow all users' for a directory or you can select specific groups that are allowed to 
authenticate to {pro} via Crowd. This option would be used if you wanted to limit repository manager access to 
specific subgroups within a larger Crowd directory. If your entire organization is stored in a single Crowd 
directory, you may want to limit repository manager access to a group that contains only developers and 
administrators.

[[crowd-configuration]]
=== Configure {pro} Crowd Integration


[[crowd-ssl]]
==== Configure {pro} to Trust Crowdâ€™s Secure URL (Optional)

Although optional, we advise the connection from {pro} to your Crowd server to use the HTTPS protocol.

If the Crowd Server certificate is not signed by a public certificate authority, you may have to explicitly trust
the server certificate using <<ssl,SSL support>>. A common symptom observed are +peer not authenticated+
messages, when trying to connect to the Crowd server.

Steps to explicitly trust the Crowd Server URL certificate in {pro} are:

. <<crowd-capability,Enable the Crowd Capability>>
. <<crowd-ssl-trust,Add the Crowd server certificate to the truststore>>
. <<crowd-config-connection,Configure Crowd Connection URL using
the HTTPS url>>

[[crowd-capability]]
===== Enable the Crowd Capability

To enable 'Crowd' go to 'Capabilities' located under 'System' in the 'Administration' menu. Perform the following 
steps:

. click the 'Create capability' button to get to the 'Select Capability Type' table
. select 'Capabilities' to open the 'Capabilities' panel located in the 'Administration' menu
. select 'Crowd' to open the 'Create Crowd Capability' panel
. Click the 'Add' button in the panel toolbar. Select 'SSL: Crowd' in the 'Type' field. Make sure the 'Enabled' 
checkbox is checked, and click the 'Save' button.

[[crowd-ssl-trust]]
===== Adding the Crowd Server Certificate to the Truststore

In order to add the server certificate of your Crowd server to the truststore, go to 'SSL Certificates', located 
under 'Security' in the 'Administration' menu. In the 'SSL Certificates' panel click the 'Load Certificate' 
button, prompts a dropdown menu with two options:

. 'Load from server', where you can enter the full +https://+ URL from the Crowd server
. 'Paste PEM', where you can enter an encoded, remote certificate generated from Crowd

NOTE: Read more about centralizing <<ssl-certificates,ssl certificates>> to the {nxrm} in the Security chapter.

[[crowd-config-connection]]
==== Configure Nexus Crowd Connection

The Crowd Configuration screen displayed in <<fig-manage-crowd-config>> can be accessed by users with 
administrative privileges in {pro} by selecting 'Atlassian Crowd' in the 'Security' section of the 
'Administration' menu.

[[fig-manage-crowd-config]]
.Crowd Configuration Panel
image::figs/web/manage-crowd-config.png[scale=60]

This panel contains the following fields:

Application Name:: This field contains the application name of a Crowd application. This value should match the 
value in the Name field of the form shown in <<fig-crowd-add-application>>.

Application Password:: This field contains the application password of a Crowd application. This value should 
match the value in the Password field of the form shown in <<fig-crowd-add-application>>.

Crowd Server URL:: This is the URL used to connect to the Crowd Server.  Both 'http://' and 'https://' URLs are 
accepted. You may need to <<crowd-ssl-trust,trust the crowd server certificate>> if a 'https://' URL is used.

HTTP Timeout:: The HTTP Timeout specifies the number of milliseconds the repository manager will wait for a
response from Crowd. A value of zero indicates that there is no timeout limit. Leave the field blank to use the
default HTTP timeout.

You can use the 'Verify Connection' button to validate if your connection to Crowd is working. Once you have a 
working connection, press 'Save' to confirm the configuration. Use 'Cancel' to abort saving any changes.

[[crowd-sect-mapping]]
=== Configure {pro} Crowd Security

There are two approaches available to manage what privileges a Crowd user has when they login to {pro}.

. Mapping Crowd Groups to Nexus Roles
. Mapping Crowd Users to Nexus Roles

NOTE: Mapping Crowd Groups to {pro} Roles is preferable because there is less configuration is involved overall in
{pro} and assigning users to Crowd groups can be centrally managed inside of Crowd by your security team after the
initial repository manager setup.

[[crowd-sect-mapping-group]]
==== Mapping a Crowd Group to {pro} Role

When mapping a Crowd group to a {pro} role, you are specifying the permissions ( via roles ) that users within the
Crowd group will have after they authenticate.

To map a Crowd group to a {pro} role, open the 'Roles' panel by clicking on the 'Roles' link under 'Security'
in the 'Administration panel. Click on 'Create role' button, select 'External Role Mapping', then click 'Crowd'. 
This will take you 'Create Role' panel, as mention in <<roles>>.

After choosing the 'Crowd' realm, the 'Role' drop-down should list all the Crowd groups the 'demo' crowd 
application has access to. Select the group to would like to map in the 'Role' field and click 'Create Mapping'.

NOTE: If you have two or more groups in Crowd accessible to the 'nexus' application with the same name but in
different directories, the repository manager will only list the first one that Crowd finds. Therefore, Crowd
administrators should avoid identically named groups in Crowd directories.

Before saving the group-to-role mapping, *you 'must' add at least one {pro} role to the mapped group*. After you
have added the roles using the 'Add' button, click the 'Save' button.

Saved mappings will appear in the list of roles with a mapping value of 'Crowd'.

[[crowd-sect-mapping-user]]
==== Mapping a Crowd User to Nexus Role

To illustrate this feature, consider the Crowd server user with an id of +johnsmith+. As visible in the Crowd
administrative interface, the user is a member of the +dev+ group.

To add an 'External User Role Mapping', open the 'Users' panel in the repository manager by clicking 'Users' in
the 'Security' section of the sidebar menu.

Click on the 'Add...' button and select 'External User Role Mapping' from the drop-down.

Selecting 'External User Role Mapping' will show a mapping panel where you can locate a user by Crowd user
id.

Typing the Crowd user id - for example +brian+ - in the 'Enter a User ID' field and clicking the magnifying glass
icon, will cause the repository manager to search for a user ID +brian+ in all known realms, including Crowd.

Once you locate the Crowd user, use 'Add' button to add roles to the Crowd User. *You must map at least one role
to the Crowd managed user* in order to 'Save'. The Mapped External Crowd User Example displays the 'brian' Crowd 
realm user as a member of the 'dev' Crowd group and the mapped role called 'Nexus Administrator Role'. External 
groups like +dev+ are bolded in the 'Role Management' list.

[[crowd-realm]]
=== Activate {pro} Crowd Realm

The final step to allow Crowd users to authenticate against {pro} is to activate the Crowd authorization realm in
the 'Security Settings'.

. Select 'Administration' -> 'Server' from the sidebar menu.
. Scroll down to the 'Security Settings' section.
. Drag 'Crowd Realm' from the list of 'Available Realms' to the end of the 'Selected Realms' list.
. 'Save' the server settings.
