== Docker Container Registry Support
{in} {oss}, {pro}, {proplus}

https://www.docker.com/[Docker] containers and their usage have revolutionized
the way applications and the underlying operation system are packaged and 
deployed to production systems.

The creation of the http://opencontainers.org/[Open Container Initiative] and 
the involvement of a large number of stakeholders, guarantees that the ecosystem
of tools around the lightweight containers and their usage will continue to 
flourish.

https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub] is the original registry for Docker 
container images and it is being joined by more and more other publicly 
available registries such as the 
https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/[Google Container Registry] and 
others.

Nexus supports Docker registries as the Docker repository format for hosted and
proxy repositories as well as exposing them to the client-side tools as a
repository group.

This allows you to reduce time and bandwidth usage for accessing Docker 
containers in a registry as well as share your containers within your 
organization in a hosted repository as a completely private Docker registry. 

[[docker-proxy]]
=== Docker Proxy Repositories

Docker Hub is the common registry used by all container creators and consumers.
To reduce duplicate downloads and improve download speeds for your developers
and CI severs, you should proxy Docker Hub and any other container registry you
use.

To proxy a Docker registry, you simply create a new 'docker (proxy)' as 
documented in <<admin-repositories>>. The 'Remote Storage' has to be set to the
URL of the remote registry you want to proxy. 

The configuration for proxying Docker Hub is partially visible in
<<fig-docker-hub-proxy>> and uses the URL `https://hub.docker.com/`.

[[docker-hosted]]
=== Docker Hosted Repositories

TBD - this is the same section from Nuget chapter- adapt to docker 

A hosted repository for NuGet can be used to upload your own
packages as well as third-party packages. Nexus includes a hosted
NuGet repository named 'nuget-hosted' by default.

 It is good practice to
create two separate hosted repositories for these purposes.

To create another NuGet hosted repository, simply create a new 'nuget
(hosted)' repository. An example configuration from the default
'nuget-hosted' repository is displayed in
<<fig-nuget-hosted-releases-configuration>>.

[[fig-nuget-hosted-releases-configuration]]

The NuGet feed is immediately updated as packages are deployed or
deleted from the host repository. 

[[docker-group]]
=== Docker Repository Groups

TBD - this is the same section from Nuget chapter- adapt to docker 

A repository group is the recommended way to expose all your NuGet
repositories from Nexus to your users, without needing any further
client side configuration. A repository group allows you to expose the
aggregated content of multiple proxy and hosted repositories with one
URL to your tools. 

Nexus includes a 'nuget-group' repository group by default. This
typical, useful example groups the 'nuget.org-proxy' proxy repository
that proxies the NuGet Gallery and the 'nuget-hosted' hosted
repository. 

Using the 'URL' of the repository group can be used in your client
tool and will give you access to the packages in all repositories from
the group with one URL. Any new packages added as well as any new
repositories added to the group will automatically be available.

=== Accessing Docker Container Images from Repositories and Groups

TBD - whats the client side config in Docker to be able to download from Nexus

[[docker-push]]
=== Pushing Container Images to Docker Hosted Repositories

TBD - docker push and so on, what about credentials, ...
