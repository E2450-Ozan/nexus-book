== Docker Container Registry Support
{in} {oss}, {pro}, {proplus}

https://www.docker.com/[Docker] containers and their usage have revolutionized the way applications and the underlying
operation system are packaged and deployed to development, testing and production systems.

The creation of the http://opencontainers.org/[Open Container Initiative] and the involvement of a large number of
stakeholders, guarantees that the ecosystem of tools around the lightweight containers and their usage will continue to
flourish.

https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub] is the original registry for Docker container images and it is being joined by more
and more other publicly available registries such as the https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/[Google Container
Registry] and others.

Nexus supports Docker registries as the Docker repository format for hosted and proxy repositories. You can then expose
these repositories to the client-side tools directly or as a repository group, which is a repository that merges and
exposes the contents of multiple repositories in one convenient URL.

This allows you to reduce time and bandwidth usage for accessing Docker containers in a registry as well as share your
containers within your organization in a hosted repository as a completely private Docker registry.

[[docker-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

Docker relies on secure connections using SSL to connect to the repositories. You are therefore required to expose Nexus
to your client tools via HTTPS. This can be configured via an external proxy server or directly with Nexus. Further
details can be found in <<ssl-inbound>>.

In addition the interaction with the Docker client requires specific ports to be used. This can be configured in
repository configuration for Docker repositories in the 'Docker Connectors' section. In order for this to work on your
network you need to ensure that the chosen ports are available in your organization and not used by some other
application and that no firewall or other network configuration prevents connectivity.

The recommended minimal configuration requires one port for a Docker repository group used for read access to all
repositories and one port for each hosted Docker repository, that will receive push events from your users.


[[docker-proxy]]
=== Docker Proxy Repositories

Docker Hub is the common registry used by all container creators and consumers.  To reduce duplicate downloads and
improve download speeds for your developers and CI severs, you should proxy Docker Hub and any other container registry
you use.

To proxy a Docker registry, you simply create a new 'docker (proxy)' as documented in <<admin-repositories>>. The
'Remote Storage' has to be set to the URL of the remote registry you want to proxy.

The configuration for proxying Docker Hub is partially visible in
<<fig-docker-hub-proxy>> and uses the URL `https://hub.docker.com/`.

[[docker-hosted]]
=== Docker Hosted Repositories

A hosted repository using the Docker repository format is typically called a
private Docker registry. It  can be used to upload your own
container images as well as third-party images. It is common practice to
create two separate hosted repositories for these purposes.

To create a Docker hosted repository, simply create a new 'docker (hosted)' 
repository as  documented in <<admin-repositories>>. An example configuration 
is displayed in <<fig-docker-hosted>>.

[[docker-group]]
=== Docker Repository Groups

A repository group is the recommended way to expose all your Docker repositories
from Nexus to your users, without needing any further client side configuration
after the initial setup. A repository group allows you to expose the aggregated
content of multiple proxy and hosted repositories with one URL to your tools. 

To create a Docker hosted repository, simply create a new 'docker (group)' 
repository as  documented in <<admin-repositories>>. An example configuration 
is displayed in <<fig-docker-group>>. It groups proxy repositories of Docker 
Hub and the Google Container Registry with hosted repositories for private 
internal and third party images.

Using the 'URL' of the repository group can be used in your client
tool and will give you access to the container images in all repositories from
the group with one URL. Any new images added as well as any new
repositories added to the group will automatically be available.
