== Using the Nexus User Interface

[[using-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

Nexus provides anonymous access for users who only need to search
repositories, browse repositories, and peruse the system feeds. This
anonymous access level changes the navigation menu and some of the
options available when you right-click on a repository. This read-only
access displays the user interface shown in
<<fig-repoman-anonymous-interface>>.

[[fig-repoman-anonymous-interface]]
.Nexus Interface for Anonymous Users
image::figs/web/repository-manager_public-interface.png[scale=50]

The Nexus user interface is used with a web browser and works best
with modern browsers. Older versions such as Microsoft Internet
Explorer 7 or earlier are not supported and actively blocked from
using Nexus to avoid an unsatisfactory user experience. Internet
Explorer 8 works up to Nexus 2.8 and is not supported for newer
releases.

The user interface is separated into a number of different
sections. 

Header::

The top of the page contains the header and on the right-hand side the
'Log In' button, which is replaced with a drop-down to log out, as well
as navigate to the users profile. The header displays the version of
Nexus and potentially the availability of a newer version.

Nexus Menu::

The left-hand side of the application features the Nexus menu, with
its numerous submenus. The panel itself can be horizontally collapsed
and expanded with the button in the top right-hand corner of the
panel. Each submenu can be vertically collapsed and expanded with the
button beside the title for each submenu. Depending on the access
rights for the current user, different submenus and menu items are
displayed.

Main Panel::

The main panel of the application to the right of the Nexus menu can
host different tabs for different selections on the submenus in the
navigation. Each tab can be closed individually and selected as the
active tab.


<<fig-repository-manager-exmple-interface>> shows a typical user
interface appearance of Nexus with multiple tabs in the main
panel. The activated panel 'Repositories' shows a list of repositories with the
current selection highlighted. The panels underneath the list show
details for the selected list item. 

[[fig-repository-manager-exmple-interface]]
.Typical Example Nexus Interface with Repository List and Details
image::figs/web/repository-manager-example-interface.png[scale=50]

The list header features buttons for various operations as well as an
input box that allows you to filter the list by any terms used in any
column. <<fig-repository-list-filtering>> shows an example use case
where a user typed "snap" in the filter box and the list of
repositories only shows snapshot repositories. This filtering works
for all columns in a list and can be used in most list displays in
Nexus. For example you can use it to filter the users list to find
disabled users, filter the routing list, the roles list and many more.

The column headers in most lists can be clicked to invoke a sorting of
the list by the respective column.

[[fig-repository-list-filtering]]
.Filtering the Repository List to Display Only Snapshot Repositories
image::figs/web/repository-list-filtering.png[scale=50]

TIP: A right mouse button click on list items exposes a context
sensitive menu of operations in some lists.

[[using-sect-browsing]]
=== Browsing Repositories

One of the most straightforward uses of Nexus is to browse the
structure of a repository. If you click on the 'Repositories' menu item
in the 'Views/Repositories' menu, you should see the following
display. The tophalf of <<fig-nexus-browse-repo>> shows you a list of
groups and repositories along with the type of the repository and the
repository status. To browse the artifacts that are stored in a local
Nexus instance, click on the Browse Storage tab for a repository as
shown in <<fig-nexus-browse-repo>>.

[[fig-nexus-browse-repo]]
.Browsing a Repository Storage
image::figs/web/repository-manager_browse-repositories.png[scale=50]
When you are browsing a repository, you can right-click on any file
and download it directly to your browser. This allows you to retrieve
specific artifacts manually or examine a POM file in
the browser. In addition, artifacts as well as directories can be
deleted using right-click.

NOTE: When browsing a remote repository you might notice that the tree
doesn't contain all of the artifacts in a repository. When you browse
a proxy repository, Nexus is displaying the artifacts that have been
cached locally from the remote repository. If you don't see an
artifact you expected to see through Nexus, it only means that Nexus
has yet to cache the artifact locally. If you have enabled remote
repository index downloads, Nexus will return search results that may
include artifacts not yet downloaded from the remote
repository. <<fig-nexus-browse-repo>>, is just an example, and you may
or may not have the example artifact available in your
installation of Nexus.

A Nexus proxy repository acts as a local cache for a remote
repository, in addition to downloading and caching artifacts locally,
Nexus will also download an index of all the artifacts stored in a
particular repository. When searching or browsing for artifacts, it is
often more useful to search and browse the repository index. To view
the repository index, click on the Browse Index tab for a particular
repository to load the interface shown in
<<fig-nexus-browse-repo-index>>.

[[fig-nexus-browse-repo-index]]
.Browsing a Repository Index
image::figs/web/repository-manager_browse-repository-index.png[scale=50]

[[using-artifact-information]]
=== Viewing the Artifact Information

Once you located an archive in the repository index or storage or via
a search the right-hand panel will at minimum show the 'Artifact
Information' tab as visible in
<<fig-using-artifact-information>>. Besides showing details like the
'Repository Path', 'Size', 'Checksums', location of the artifact and other
details, you are able to download and delete the artifact with the
respective buttons.

[[fig-using-artifact-information]]
.Viewing the Artifact Information
image::figs/web/using-artifact-information.png[scale=50]

[[using-artifact-maven-information]]
=== Viewing the Maven Information

If the artifact you are examining is a Maven-related artifact like a
pom file or a jar, you will see the 'Maven Information' tab in the
right-hand panels. As visible in <<fig-using-maven-information>>, the
GAV parameters are displayed above an XML snippet identifying the
artifact that you can just cut and paste into a Maven pom.xml file.

[[fig-using-maven-information]]
.Viewing the Maven Information
image::figs/web/using-maven-information.png[scale=60]


[[custom-metadata-plugin]]
=== View and Editing Artifact Metadata

Support for custom metadata is part of Nexus Professional. You can
view, edit, and search for additional metadata associated to any
artifact in your Nexus repositories.

The features for custom metadata usage need to be activated by adding
and enabling the 'Custom Metadata' capability as described in
<<capabilities>>.

Prior to Nexus 2.7 custom metadata support was an optional plugin that
needed to be installed, following the instructions in
<<install-additional-plugins>>.  The directory containing the plugin
code is called nexus-custom-metadata-plugin-X.Y.Z. Install the plugin

Security privileges allow you to define "read only" as well as "write"
access for custom metadata as well as grant or disallow access.

When viewing a specific artifact from browsing repository storage or a
repository index or from a search, the 'Artifact Metadata' tab
displays the interface shown in <<fig-using-viewing-metadata>>.

[[fig-using-viewing-metadata]]
.Viewing Artifact Metadata
image::figs/web/meta_existing-meta-value.png[scale=60]

Artifact metadata consists of a key, a value, and a namespace.
Existing metadata from an artifact's POM is given a +urn:maven+
namespace, and custom attributes are stored under the +urn:nexus/user+
namespace.

To add a custom attribute, click on an artifact in Nexus, and select
the 'Artifact Metadata' tab. Click 'Add...' there and a new row will
be inserted into the list of attributes. Supply a 'Key' and 'Value'
and click 'Save' to update the artifact's
metadata. <<fig-using-editing-metadata>> shows the Artifact Metadata
panel with two custom attributes: "approvedBy" and "approved".

[[fig-using-editing-metadata]]
.Editing Artifact Metadata
image::figs/web/meta_setting-meta-value.png[scale=60]


[[archive-browser]]
=== Using the Artifact Archive Browser

For binary artifacts like jar files Nexus displays an 'Archive Browser'
panel, as visible in <<fig-archive-browser>> that allows
you to view the contents of the archive. Clicking on invidiual files
in the browser will download them and potentially display them in your
browser. This can be useful for quickly checking out the contents of
an archive without manually downloading and extracting it.

[[fig-archive-browser]]
.Using the Archive Browser
image::figs/web/using-archive-browser.png[scale=60]

IMPORTANT: The archive browser is a feature of Nexus Professional.

[[dependency-inspection]]
=== Inspecting the Component Dependencies

Nexus Professional provides you with the ability to browse an
artifact's dependencies. Using the artifact metadata found in an
artifact's POM, Nexus will scan a repository or a repository group and
attempt to resolve and display an artifact's dependencies. To view an
artifact's dependencies, browse the repository storage or the
repository index, select an artifact (or an artifact's POM), and then
click on the 'Maven Dependency' tab.

On the 'Maven Dependency' tab, you will see the following form elements:

Repository:: When resolving an artifact's dependencies, Nexus will
query an existing repository or repository group. In many cases it
will make sense to select the same repository group you are
referencing in your Maven settings. If you encounter any problems
during the dependency resolution, you need to make sure that you are
referencing a repository or a group that contains these dependencies.

Mode:: An artifact's dependencies can be listed as either a tree or a
list. When dependencies are displayed in a tree, you can inspect
direct dependencies and transitive dependencies. This can come in
handy if you are assessing an artifact, based on the dependencies it is
going to pull into your project's build. When you list dependencies as
a list, Nexus is going to perform the same process used by Maven to
collapse a tree of dependencies into a list of dependencies using
rules to merge and override dependency versions if there are any
overlaps or conflicts.

Once you have selected a repository to resolve against and a mode to
display an artifact's dependencies, click on 'Resolve' as
shown in <<fig-using-dependencies>>. Clicking on this button will
start the process of resolving dependencies, depending on the number
of artifacts already cached by Nexus, this process can take anywhere
from a few seconds to a minute. Once the resolution process is finished,
you should see the artifact's dependencies, as shown in
<<fig-using-dependencies>>.

[[fig-using-dependencies]]
.View an Artifact's Dependencies
image::figs/web/using_dependencies.png[scale=60]

Once you have resolved an artifact's dependencies, you can use the
Filter text input to search for particular artifact dependencies.  If
you double-click on a row in the tree or list of dependencies, you can
navigate to other artifacts within the Nexus interface.

[[component-info]]
=== Viewing Component Security and License Information

One of the added features of Nexus Professional is the usage of data
from Sonatype CLM. This data contains security and license
information about artifacts and is accessible for a whole repository
in the Repository Health Check feature described in <<rhc>>.  Details
about the vulnerability and security issue ratings and others can be
found there as well.

The 'Component Info' tab displays the security and licence information
available for a specific artifact. It is available in browsing or
search results, once a you have selected an artifact in the search
results list or repository tree view. An example search for Jetty, with
the 'Component Info' tab visible, is displayed in <<fig-clm-tab-jetty>>.  It
displays the results from the 'License Analysis' and any found 'Security
Issues'. 

The 'License Analysis' reveals a medium threat triggered by the fact
that Non-Standard license headers were found in the source code as visible
in the 'Observed License(s) in Source' column. The license found in the
pom.xml file associated to the project only documented Apache-2.0 or
EPL-1.0 as the 'Declared License(s)'.

[[fig-clm-tab-jetty]]
.Component Info Displaying Security Vulnerabilities for an Old Version of Jetty 
image::figs/web/component-info-tab-jetty.png[scale=50]

The 'Security Issues' section displays two issues with 'Threat Level'
values 5. The 'Summary' column contains a small summary description of
the security issue. The 'Problem Code' column contains the codes,
which link to the respective entries in the Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures CVE list as well as the Open Source Vulnerability DataBase
OSVDB displayed in <<fig-clm-cve-jetty>> and
<<fig-clm-osvdb-jetty>>.

.Understanding the Difference, Nexus Professional - CLM Edition


In this section, we've talked about the various ways CLM data is being used, at
least at an introductory level. However, understanding the differences between
the Sonatype CLM usage in Nexus Professional and Nexus Professional CLM may 
still be a little unclear. Rather you are likely asking, "What do I get with Nexus Professional - Sonatype CLM Edition.

Great question. With Sonatype CLM, Nexus Professional is expanded in the two key
areas.

Policy Management::

Your organization likely has a process for determining which components can be
included in your applications. This could be as simple as limiting the age of
the component, or more complex, like prohibiting components with a certain type
of licenses or security issue.

Whatever the case, the process is supported by rules. Sonatype CLM Policy
management is a way to create those rules, and then track and evaluate your
application. Any time a rule is broken, that's considered a policy violation.
Violations can then warn, or even prevent a release.

Here's an example of the Sonatype CLM features for Nexus Staging.

[[fig-clm-staging-repository-failure]]
.Staging Repository Activity with a CLM Evaluation Failure and Details
image::figs/web/clm-staging-repository-failure.png[scale=60]

Component Information Panel::

The Component Information Panel, or CIP, provides everything you need to know
about a component. Looking at the image below, you'll notice two sections. On
the left, details about the specific component are provided. On the right, the
graph provides a wide variety of information including popularity, license, or
security issues. You can even click on each individual version in the graph,
which will then display on the left.
+
[[fig-nexus-clm-nexus-show-cip]]
.Component Information Panel Example
image::figs/web/nexus-clm-comp-info-cip.png[scale=50]
+
NOTE: The CIP is then expanded with the View Details button which shows exactly
what security or license issues were encountered, as well as any policy
violations.

If you would like more information about these features, check out our
link:http://books.sonatype.com/sonatype-clm-book/html/repository-manager-user-guide/index.html[Sonatype
CLM Repository Manager Guide].

[[using-sect-browse-groups]]
=== Browsing Groups

Nexus contains ordered groups of repositories that allow you to expose
a series of repositories through a single URL. More often than not, an
organization is going to point Maven at the default Nexus groups
'Public Repositories'. Most endusers of Nexus are not going to know
what artifacts are being served from what specific repository, and
they are going to want to be able to browse the public repository
group. 

To support this use case, Nexus allows you to browse the contents of a
repository group as if it were a single merged repository with a tree
structure.  <<fig-nexus-browse-group>>, shows the browsing storage
interface for a repository group. There is no difference to the user
experience of browsing a repository group vs. browsing a repository.

[[fig-nexus-browse-group]]
.Browsing a Nexus Group
image::figs/web/repository-manager_browse-group.png[scale=60]

When browsing a repository group's storage, you are browsing the underlying
storage for all of the repositories in a group. If a repository group
contains proxy repositories, the 'Browse Storage' tab will show all of
the artifacts in the group that have been downloaded from the
remote repositories. To browse and search all artifacts available in a
group, click on the 'Browse Index' tab to load the interface shown
in <<fig-nexus-browse-group-index>>.

[[fig-nexus-browse-group-index]]
.Browsing a Nexus Group Index
image::figs/web/repository-manager_browse-group-index.png[scale=60]

[[search-components]]
=== Searching for Components

==== Search Overview

In the left-hand navigation area, there is an 'Artifact Search' text
field next to a magnifying glass. To search for an artifact by groupId
or artifactId, type in some text and click the magnifying glass.
Typing in the search term +junit+ and clicking the
magnifying glass should yield a search result similar to
<<fig-search-results>>.

[[fig-search-results]]
.Results of an Artifact Search for "junit"
image::figs/web/search-results.png[scale=50]

The groupId in the 'Group' column and the artifactId in the 'Artifact'
column identify each row in the search results table. Each row
represents an aggregration of all artifacts in this 'Group' and
'Artifact' coordinate.

The 'Version' column displays the lastest version number available as
well as a link to 'Show All Versions'.

The 'Most Popular Version' column displays the version that has the most
downloads by all users accessing the Central Repository. This data can
help with the selection of an appropriate version to use for a
particular artifact.

The 'Download' column displays direct links to all the artifacts
available for the latest version. A typical list of
downloadable artifacts would include the Java archive 'jar', the Maven
pom.xml file 'pom', a Javadoc archive 'javadoc.jar' and a Sourcecode
archive 'sources.jar', but other download options are also added if
more artifacts are available. Click on the link to download an
artifact.

Each of the columns in the search results table can be used to sort
the table in 'Ascending' or 'Descending' order. In addition, you can choose
to add and remove colums with the sort and column drop-down options
visible in <<fig-search-results-column-options>>.

[[fig-search-results-column-options]]
.Sort and Column Options in the Search Results Table
image::figs/web/search-results-column-options.png[scale=50]

The repository browser interface below the search results table will
displays the artifact selected in the list in the repository structure
with the same information panels available documented in
<<using-sect-browsing>>. An artifact could be present in more than one
repository. If this is the case, click on the value next to 'Viewing
Repository' to switch between multiple matching repositories.

WARNING: Let me guess? You installed Nexus, ran to the search box,
typed in the name of a group or an artifact, pressed search, and saw
absolutely nothing. No results. Nexus isn't going to retrieve the
remote repository indexes by default. You need to activate downloading
of remote indexes for the three proxy repositories that Nexus are
shipped with Nexus. Without these indexes, Nexus has nothing to
search. Find instructions for activating index downloads in
<<confignx-sect-manage-repo>>.


==== Advanced Search

Clicking on the (Show All Versions) link in the Version column visible
in <<fig-search-results>> will initiate an 'Advanced Search' by the
groupId and artifactId of the row and result in a view similar to
<<fig-search-results-all-versions>>.

[[fig-search-results-all-versions]]
.Advanced Search Results for a GAV Search Activated by the Show All Versions Link
image::figs/web/search-results-advanced-gav.png[scale=50]

The header for the 'Advanced Search' contains a selector for the type of
search and one or more text input fields to define a search and a
button to run a new search with the specified parameters.

The search results table contains one row per 'Group' (groupId),
'Artifact' (artifactId), and 'Version'(version). 

In addition, the 'Age' column displays the age of the artifacts being
available on the Central Repository. Since most artifacts are
published to the Central Repository when released, this age gives you a
good indication of the actual time since the release of the artifact.

The 'Popularity' column shows a relative popularity as compared to the
other results in the search table. This can give you a good idea
on the adoption rate of a new release. For example if a newer version has a
high age value, but a low popularity compared to an older version, you
might want to check the upstream project and see if there is any
issues stopping other users from upgrading that might affect you as
well. Another reason could be that the new version does not provide
signifcant improvements to warrant an upgrade for most users.

The 'Security Issues' column shows the number of known security issues
for the specific artifact. The 'License Threat' column shows a colored
square with blue indicating no license threat and yellow, orange and
red indicating increased license threats. More information about both
indicators can be seen in the 'Component Info' panel below the list of
artifacts for the specific artifact.

The 'Download' column provides download links for all the available
artifacts.

The following advanced searches are available:

Keyword Search:: Identical to the 'Artifact Search' in the left-hand
navigation, this search will look for the specified strings in the
groupId and artifactId.

Classname Search:: Rather than looking at the coordinates of an
artifact in the repository, the 'Classname Search' will look at the
contents of the artifacts and look for Java classes with the specified
name. For example, try a search for a classname of +Pair+ to see how
many library authors saw a need to implement such a class, saving you
from potentially implementing yet another version.

GAV Search:: The GAV search allows a search using the Maven
coordinatess of an artifact. These are 'Group' (groupId), 'Artifact'
(artifactId), 'Version' (version), 'Packaging' (packaging), and 'Classifier'
(classifier). At a minimum you need to specify a group, artifact, or
version in your search. An example search would be with an artifact
+guice+ and a classifier +no_aop+ or a group of
+org.glassfish.main.admingui+ and a packaging +war+. The default
packaging is 'jar', with other values as used in the Maven packaging
like 'ear', 'war', 'maven-plugin', 'pom', 'ejb' and many others being
possible choices.

Checksum Search:: Sometimes it is necessary to determine the version
of a jar artifact in order to migrate to a qualified version. When
attempting this and neither the filename nor the contents of the
manfiest file in the jar contain any useful information about the
exact version of the jar, you can use 'Checksum Search' to identify the
artifact. Create a sha1 checksum, e.g., with the +sha1sum+ command
available on Linux or +fciv+ on Windows, and use the created string in a
checksum search. This will return one result, which will provide you
with the GAV coordinates to replace the jar file with a dependency
declaration.
 
Metadata Search:: Search for artifacts with specific metadata
properties is documented in <<sect-metadata-search>>.

TIP: The checksum search can be a huge timesaver when migrating a
legacy build system, where the used libraries are checked into the
version control system as binary artifacts with no version information
available.

[[sect-metadata-search]]
==== Searching Artifact Metadata

To search for artifacts with specific metadata, click on the 'Advanced
Search' link directly below the search field in the 'Artifact Search'
submenu of the Nexus menu. This opens the 'Search' panel and allows
you to select 'Metadata Search' in the search type drop-down as shown
in <<fig-using-search-metadata>>.

[[fig-using-search-metadata]]
.Searching Artifact Metadata
image::figs/web/meta_search-selection.png[scale=60]

Once you select the metadata search you will see two search fields and
an operator drop-down. The two search fields are the key and value of
the metadata for which you are searching. The operator drop-down can be set
to 'Equals', 'Matches', 'Key Defined', or 'Not Equal'. 'Equals' and 'Not Equals'
compare the value for a specific key. 'Matches' allows the usage of +\*+
to allow any characters. E.g., looking for +tr*+ would match +true+ but
also match +tree+. The 'Key Defined' operator will ignore any value provided
and return all artifacts with the supplied key.

.Metadata Search Results for Custom Metadata
image::figs/web/meta_search-function.png[scale=60]

Once you locate a matching artifact in the results list,
click on the artifact and then select the Artifact Metadata to examine
an artifacts metadata as shown in <<fig-using-search-metadata-results>>.

[[fig-using-search-metadata-results]]
.Metadata Search Results for Custom Metadata
image::figs/web/meta_search-result-0.png[scale=60]


[[rhc-example-security]]
=== Search Example: Analyzing a Security Vulnerability

The following example details how you can analyze security issues of
an artifact and determine a solution with the help of information available in
Nexus.

You noticed the artifact with the 'Group' org.springframework, the
'Artifact' spring-beans and 'Version' 2.5.4. Upon further inspection
of your software build and the components used, you can confirm that
this artifact is indeed part of your shipping software. You might have
discovered the need to investigate this initially by performing a
repository health check as documented in the prior sections of <<rhc>>
or an external resource such as a security mailing list.

TIP: http://links.sonatype.com/products/insight/ci/home[Sonatype
CLM for CI] can help you with the detection of license and
security issues during continuous integration builds. 
http://links.sonatype.com/products/insight/ac/home[Sonatype App Health
Check] allows you to analyze already assembled application archives.

A GAV search for the artifact in Nexus as documented in
<<search-components>> allows you to inspect the 'Component Info'
tab for the artifact displayed in <<fig-rhc-spring-component-info>>.

[[fig-rhc-spring-component-info]]
.GAV Search Results for +org.springframework:spring-beans+ and Component Info Tab for Version 2.5.4
image::figs/web/rhc-spring-component-info.png[scale=45]

For example, after reading the summary and inspecting the entries for the 
security issues in the security databases linked in the 'Problem Code' column,
you decide that these issues affect your software and a fix is
required. In order to determine your next steps you search for all
versions of the +spring-beans+ artifact. As a result you receive the
list of all versions available partially displayed in
<<fig-rhc-spring-list>>. The 'Security' column in the search results
list displays the count of two security issues for the version 2.5.4
of the library.

[[fig-rhc-spring-list]]
.Viewing Multiple Versions of org.springframework:spring-beans:x
image::figs/web/rhc-spring-list.png[scale=45]

Looking at the 'Security Issues' column in the results allows you to
determine that with the upgrade of the library to version 2.5.6.SEC02
the count of security issues drops to zero. The same applies to
version 2.5.6.SEC03, which appears to be the latest version of the 2.x
version of the artifact. In addition, the table shows that early
versions of the 3.x releases were affected by security issues as well.

With these results, you decide that an immediate update to version
2.5.6.SEC03 will be required as your next step. In the longer term an
update to a newer version of the 3.x or even 4.x releases will follow.

The necessary steps to upgrade depend on your usage of the
spring-beans library. A direct usage of the library will allow you to
upgrade it directly. In most cases, this will require an upgrade of
other SpringFramework libraries. If you are indirectly using
spring-beans as a transitive dependency, you will need to figure out
how to upgrade either the dependency causing the inclusion or override
the version used.

The necessary steps will depend on the build system used, but in all
cases you now have the information at your hands detailing why you should
upgrade and what to what version to upgrade to. This allows you to carry out
your component lifecycle management effectively. Sonatype CLM offers
tools for these migration efforts as well as various ways to monitor
your development for security, license, and other issues.

[[rhc-example-license]]
=== Search Example: Resolving a License Issue

The following example details how you can analyze a license issue of
an artifact found in your repository health check and determine a
solution with the help of information available in Nexus. The same
need for investigation might have been triggered by external means
such as a need to do a legal review of all components as part of your
release components and the requirement to manage a comprehensive bill
of materials.

Your repository health check detail report indicated that Hibernate
3.2.7.ga might have issues due to its 'Threat Level' declared as
'Non-Standard'. Looking at your software artifacts you found that you
are indeed using this version of Hibernate. Searching for the artifact
in Nexus provides you with the search results list and the Component
Info tab for the specific version displayed in <<fig-rhc-hibernate>>.

[[fig-rhc-hibernate]]
.Viewing License Analysis Results for Hibernate
image::figs/web/rhc-hibernate.png[scale=50]

The 'Component Info' tab displays the declared license of Hibernate
is the LGPL-3.0 license. Contrary to that, the licenses observed in the
source code include Apache-1.1, Apache-2.0, LGPL-2.1, LGPL and
Non-Standard. 

Looking at newer versions of Hibernate you find that the observed
license in the source code changed to 'Not-Provided'. Given this change
you can conclude that the license headers in the individual source
code files were removed or otherwise altered and the declared license
was modified to LGPL-2.1.

With this information in hand you determine that you will need to
contact your lawyers to figure out if you are okay to upgrade to a
newer version of Hibernate to remedy the uncertainty of the
license. In addition, you will need to decide if the LGPL-2.0 is
compatible with the distribution mechanism of your software and
approved by your lawyers.

In the above steps you learned how Nexus provides a lot of information
allowing you to effectively carry out our component lifecycle
management with a minimum amount of effort.

[[using-sect-uploading]]
=== Uploading Artifacts 

When your build makes use of proprietary or custom dependencies that
are not available from public repositories, you will often need to
find a way to make them available to developers in a custom Maven
repository. Nexus ships with a preconfigured third-party repository
that was designed to hold third-party dependencies that are used in
your builds. To upload artifacts to a repository, select a hosted
repository in the 'Repositories' panel and then click on the 'Artifact
Upload' tab. Clicking on the 'Artifact Upload' tab will display the
tab shown in <<fig-using-artifact-upload>>.

[[fig-using-artifact-upload]]
.Artifact Upload Tab
image::figs/web/using_artifact-upload.png[scale=50]

To upload an artifact, click on 'Select Artifact(s) to Upload...', and
select one or more artifacts from the filesystem to upload. Once you
have selected an artifact, you can modify the classifier and the
extension before clicking on the 'Add Artifact' button. Once you have
clicked on the 'Add Artifact' button, you can then configure the source
of the 'Group', 'Artifact', 'Version' (GAV) parameters. 

If the artifact you are uploading is a jar file that was created by
Maven it will already have POM information embedded in it. If you are
uploading a jar from a vendor you will likely need to set the group
identifier, artifact identifier, and version manually. To do this,
select 'GAV Parameters' from the 'GAV Definition' drop-down at the top of
this form. This will expose a set of form fields
which will let you set the 'Group', 'Artifact', 'Version', and 'Packaging' of
the artifacts being uploaded. Packaging can be selected from the list
or provided by typing the value into the input box.

If you would prefer to set the group, artifact, and version from a POM
file associated with the uploaded artifact, select 'From POM' in the 'GAV
Definition' drop-down.  This will
expose a button labeled 'Select POM to Upload'. Once a POM file has
been selected for upload, the name of the POM file will be displayed
in the form field below this button.

TIP: Uploading a POM file allows you to add further details like
dependencies to the file, which improves the quality of the upload by
enabling transitive dependency management.

The 'Artifact Upload' panel supports multiple artifacts with the same
group, artifact, and version identifiers. For example, if you need to
upload multiple artifacts with different classifiers, you may do so by
clicking on 'Select Artifact(s) for Upload' and 'Add Artifact' multiple
times. A common use case for this upload is to upload the pom and jar
file as well as the javadoc and sources jar files file for an artifact.

[[using-sect-feeds]]
=== Browsing System Feeds

Nexus provides feeds that expose system events. You can browse these
feeds by clicking on 'System Feeds' under the 'Views/Repositories'
menu.  Clicking on 'System Feeds' will show the panel in
<<fig-repoman-system-feeds>>. You can use this simple interface to
browse the most recent reports of artifact deployments, cached
artifacts, broken artifacts, storage changes and other events that
have occurred in Nexus.

[[fig-repoman-system-feeds]]
.Browsing Nexus System Feeds
image::figs/web/repository-manager_system-feed.png[scale=70]

These feeds can come in handy if you are working at a large
organization with multiple development teams deploying to the same
instance of Nexus. In such an arrangement, all developers in an
organization can subscribe to the RSS feeds for New Deployed Artifacts
as a way to ensure that everyone is aware when a new release has been
pushed to Nexus. Exposing these system events as RSS feeds also opens
the door to other, more creative uses of this information, such as
connecting Nexus to external, automated testing systems. To access the
RSS feeds for a specific feed, select the feed in the System Feeds
view panel and then click on the Subscribe button. Nexus will then
load the RSS feed in your browse and you can subscribe to the feed in
your favorite RSS

There are a number of system feeds available in the System Feeds view,
and each has a URL that resembles the following URL:

----
http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/feeds/recentlyChangedFiles
----

The URLs can be ammended with the parameters +from+ and +count+ to 
specify the dataset viewed. E.g.  

----
http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/feeds/recentlyDeployedArtifacts?count=100
----

Where recentChanges would be replaced with the identifier of the feed
you were attempting to read. Available system feeds include:

- Authentication and Authorization Events

- Broken artifacts in all Nexus repositories

- Broken files in all Nexus repositories

- Error and Warning events

- New artifacts in all Nexus repositories

- New cached artifacts in all Nexus repositories

- New cached files in all Nexus repositories

- New cached release artifacts in all Nexus repositories

- New deployed artifacts in all Nexus repositories

- New deployed files in all Nexus repositories

- New deployed release artifacts in all Nexus repositories

- New files in all Nexus repositories

- New release artifacts in all Nexus repositories

- Recent artifact storage changes in all Nexus repositories

- Recent file storage changes in all Nexus repositories

- Recent release artifact storage changes in all Nexus repositories

- Repository Status Changes in Nexus

- System changes in Nexus
