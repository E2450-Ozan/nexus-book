=== Preparing a Backup for {nxrm}

In preparation for a back up, {nxrm} provides a scheduled task that allows you to export databases to a
relative location. The task only exports databases, therefore you need develop a strategy to backup these
exported files. When you run an export of these settings and metadata, which come from the database,
they will be input into the relative path you configure. If your plan is to back up your entire repository
manager back up the application to a secondary location as part of your strategy, so you can preserve any
configurations for restoration.

When an export task is run, no write access is available for the databases.

The databases that you export have pointers to blob stores, which contain components and assets potentially
across multiple repositories. If not backed up together the component metadata can point to non-existent
blob stores, or the blob store metadata may be non-descript when attempting to restore the exported data.
So, it's recommended that you back up both your database and blob stores in order to keep the data intact.

Here's a common scenario to back up references and explicit parts of your repository manager in a piecemeal
fashion:

* configure the export backup task for a database export
* run the scheduled task to export the databases to a relative path
* back up the databases in the relative path
* back up the contents of the installation directory, application directory, data directory, server components,
libraries, and control scripts
* back up the blob store
* copy all backed-up directories, configurations, and exported databases to a safe location
* restore the backed-up directories, configurations, and exported databases to operation
* test backups and exports from the restore procedure routinely

[[backup-task]]
=== Configuring and Running a Database Backup Task

To configure and run a new task for database backup, review the steps in the Configuration chapter. The form
for this task includes an additional field called 'Backup location', which requires you to enter the path to a
directory where you want to store backup data, shown in <<fig-backup-task>>.

////
expand the statement below, place it in the Preparation section
////
When the task runs it exports backup data to the directory in the file path added to the 'Backup location'
field. The directory you choose will contain +.bak+ files of the following databases:

Access log:: login and usage information among repository manager users 
Analytics:: event data and overall repository manager usage
Auditing:: a record of repository manager configuration changes as well as asset or component additions and
removals
Component:: all related data that make up components within the repository manager 
Configuration:: general adminstrative configurations such as scheduled tasks, email server configuration, etc.
Security:: all user and access rights management content

All backup files are presented in the timestamp format based on the time the task was started.
