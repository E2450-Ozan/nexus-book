[[backup-preparation]]
=== Preparing a Backup for {nxrm}

Preparing for back up and restoration of {nxrm} is critical to your organization.
////
Users must 1) export Orient databases then 2) back up the entire NXRM (app dir, data dir, blobs, et al)
All of NXRM except for the Orient databases can be backed up using a file system backup.
Test periodicallyThe Orient databases may have an unflushed state, so itâ€™s best to do a database export
(wrong term) and back up the exported files instead.
Create & schedule task, run task, task exports bak files, back up the backed up application/data directories
to a safe location (some of this may recur in the configuration section of the chapter

Formalize: Before you execute a backup of your OrientDB, select a backup tool of your preference to
back your content, i.e. accesslog, components, system configuration, and security
////

[[backup-task]]
=== Configuring and Running a Database Backup Task

{nxrm} allows you to back up your underlying databases for both a single-node deployment or a cluster of
multiple nodes, when activating <<high-availability,high availability>>.

To configure and run a new task for database backup, review the steps in the Configuration chapter. The form
for this task includes an additional field called 'Backup location', which requires you to enter the path to a
directory where you want to store backup data, shown in <<fig-backup-task>>.

////
expand the statement below, place it in the Preparation section
////
When the task runs it exports backup data to the directory in the file path added to the 'Backup location'
field. The directory you choose will contain +.bak+ files of the following databases:

Access log:: login and usage information among repository manager users 
Analytics:: event data and overall repository manager usage
Auditing:: a record of repository manager configuration changes as well as asset or component additions and
removals
Component:: all related data that make up components within the repository manager 
Configuration:: general adminstrative configurations such as scheduled tasks, email server configuration, etc.
Security:: all user and access rights management content

All backup files are presented in the timestamp format based on the time the task was started.
