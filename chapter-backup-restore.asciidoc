=== Preparing a Backup for {nxrm}

In preparation for a back up, {nxrm} provides a scheduled task that allows you to export databases to a relative
location. When you run the export of these settings and metadata, which come from the database, they will be  placed
together in a relative path you choose. This is the only action you can perform with the task. If your plan is to back
up your entire repository manager consider options to backup the application to a secondary location, so you can preserve
any configurations.

The databases that you export have pointers to blob stores, which contain components and asset potentially across multiple
repositories. If not backed up together the component metadata can point to non-existent blob stores, or the blob store
metadata may be non-descript when attempting to restore the exported data. So, It's recommended that you back up both you
database and blob stores in order to keep the data intact.

Here's a common scenario to backup all parts of your repository manager:

* configure the export backup task for a database export
* run the scheduled task to export the databases to a relative location
* Back up the entire repository manager, e.g. application directory 
* Restore the backed-up, exported files
////
Formalize: Before you execute a backup of your OrientDB, select a backup tool of your preference to
back your content, i.e. accesslog, components, system configuration, and security

=== Configuring and Running a Database Backup Task

To configure and run a new task for database backup, review the steps in the Configuration chapter. The form
for this task includes an additional field called 'Backup location', which requires you to enter the path to a
directory where you want to store backup data, shown in <<fig-backup-task>>.

////
expand the statement below, place it in the Preparation section
////
When the task runs it exports backup data to the directory in the file path added to the 'Backup location'
field. The directory you choose will contain +.bak+ files of the following databases:

Access log:: login and usage information among repository manager users 
Analytics:: event data and overall repository manager usage
Auditing:: a record of repository manager configuration changes as well as asset or component additions and
removals
Component:: all related data that make up components within the repository manager 
Configuration:: general adminstrative configurations such as scheduled tasks, email server configuration, etc.
Security:: all user and access rights management content

All backup files are presented in the timestamp format based on the time the task was started.
