== OSGi Bundle Repositories

[[osgi-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

Nexus Professional supports the OSGi Bundle Repository format. The
OSGi Bundle format is defined by the http://www.osgi.org/Download/File?url=/download/rfc-0112_BundleRepository.pdf[OSGi
RFC 112 "Bundle Repository"]. It is a format for the
distribution of OSGi "bundles" which includes any components that are
described by the OSGi standards set forth in RFC 112. An OBR
repository has a single XML file which completely describes the
contents of the entire repository.  Nexus Professional can read this
OBR repository XML and create proxy repositories which can download
OSGi bundles from remote OBR repositories.  Nexus Professional can
also act as a hosting platform for OSGi bundles, you can configure
your builds to publish OSGi bundles to Nexus Professional, and then
you can expose these bundle repositories to internal or external
developers using Nexus Professional as a publishing and distribution
platform.

Nexus Professional can also act as a bridge between Maven repositories
and OSGi bundle repositories. When you configure a virtual OBR
repository which uses a Maven 2 repository as a source repository,
Nexus Professional will expose artifacts with the appropriate metadata
from the Maven repository as OSGi bundles. In this way, you can unify
your OSGi and non-OSGi development efforts and publish artifacts with
the appropriate OSGi metadata to Nexus Professional. Non-OSGi clients
can retrieve software artifacts from a Maven repository, and
OSGi-aware clients can retrieve OSGi bundles from a virtual OBR
repository.  

The following sections detail the procedures for creating and managing
OBR repositories.

[[osgi-sect-proxy]]
=== Proxy OSGi Bundle Repositories

Nexus can proxy an OSGi Bundle Repository, using the OBR
repository XML as the remote storage location. To create a new proxy OBR
repository:

. Login as an Administrator.

. Click Repositories in the Left Navigation Menu.

. Click the Add.. button above the list of Nexus repositories,
and choose Proxy repository from the drop-down of repository
types.

. In the New Proxy Repository window,

.. Select OBR as the Provider.

.. Supply an id and a repository name.

.. Enter the URL to the remote repository OBR XML as the
Remote Storage location.

.. Click Save.

<<fig-obr-create-proxy>> provides some sample
configuration used to create a proxy of the Apache Felix OBR repository.

To verify that the OBR proxy repository has been properly
configured, you can then load the OBR XML from Nexus Professional. If
Nexus Professional is properly configured, you will be able load the
obr.xml by navigating to the
obr.xml
directory:

$curl http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/felix-proxy/.meta/obr.xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='http://www2.osgi.org/www/obr2html.xsl'?>

              presentationname='Servlet 2.1 API' 
              symbolicname='org.apache.felix.javax.servlet' 
    uri='../bundles/org.apache.felix.javax.servlet-1.0.0.jar' 
              version='1.0.0'>

[[osgi-sect-hosted]]
=== Hosted OSGi Bundle Repositories

Nexus can host an OSGi Bundle Repository, providing you
with a way to publish your own OBR bundles. To create an OBR hosted
repository:

. Login as an Administrator.

. Click Repositories in the Left Navigation Menu.

. Click the Add.. button above the list of Nexus repositories,
and choose Hosted repository from the drop-down of repository
types.

. In the New Hosted Repository window,

.. Select OBR as the Provider.

. Supply an id and a repository name.

. Click Save.

<<fig-obr-create-hosted>> provides some sample
configuration used to create a hosted OBR repository.

[[osgi-sect-virtual]]
=== Virtual OSGi Bundle Repositories

Nexus Professional can also be configured to convert a
traditional Maven repository into an OSGi Bundle repository using a
virtual OBR repository. To configure a virtual OBR repository:

. Login as an Administrator.

. Click Repositories in the Left Navigation Menu.

. Click the Add.. button above the list of Nexus repositories,
and choose Virtual repository from the drop-down of repository
types.

. In the New Virtual Repository window,

.. Select OBR as the Provider.

.. Select another repository's ID in the Source Nexus
Repository ID drop-down

.. Supply an id and a repository name.

.. Click Save.

The next figure provides some sample
configuration used to create a virtual OBR repository which transforms
the proxy repository for Maven Central into an OBR repository.

[[osgi-sect-grouping]]
=== Grouping OSGi Bundle Repositories

Just like Nexus can group Maven repositories, Eclipse update
sites, and P2 repositories, Nexus can also be configured to group OSGi
Bundle Repositories. To group OSGi bundle repositories:

. Login as an Administrator.

. Click Repositories in the Left Navigation Menu.

. Click the Add.. button above the list of Nexus repositories, and
choose Repository Group from the drop-down of repository types.

. In the New Repository Group window,

.. Select OBR Group as the Provider.

.. Drag and drop one or more hosted, proxy, or virtual OSGi
Bundle repositories into the new group.

.. Supply an id and a repository name.

.. Click Save.

<<fig-obr-create-group>> shows an example of the a
new repository group which contains a hosted OSGi Bundle repository, a
virtual OSGi Bundle repository, and a OSGi Bundle proxy repository.
