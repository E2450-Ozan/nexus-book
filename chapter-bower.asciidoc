[[bower-introduction]]
=== Introduction

http://bower.io[Bower] is a package manager for front-end web development. Consumers of JavaScript 
packages who routinely build projects need to keep track of and access remote packages. Using Bower 
ensures front-end packages are up to date (or set to the specific versions you need). The package manager 
installs the right versions of the packages you need and their dependencies. Bower can manage such components 
as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.

{pro} and {oss} support the Bower registry format for proxy repositories. This allows the repository manager 
to take advantage of the packages in the Bower registry and other public registries without incurring repeated 
downloads of packages, since they will be proxied in the repository manager. The proxy allows {pro} and {oss} 
to grab artifacts from Bower. To use Bower with the Nexus 3 Repository Manager, you will need to install and configure a pluggable resolver that allows Bower to interact with the repository manager.

Bower is optimized for the front-end. If multiple packages depend on a single package Bower will download a 
component (e.g jQuery) just once. This is known as a flat dependency graph and it helps reduce page load.

[[bower-proxying]]
=== Proxying Bower Repositories

You can set up a proxy repository inside of the repository manager. This enables the system 
to proxy other Nexus Bower registries. To reduce duplicate downloads and improve download 
speeds for your developers and CI servers, you should proxy the registry hosted at 
http://bower.herokuapp.com/[http://bower.herokuapp.com]. By default Bower accesses this registry directly. You can also proxy any other registries you require.

When rewrite capabilities are activated the Bower resolver forces itself to Nexus to retrieve an artifact (e.g. 
tar.gz). 

If deactivated, no rewrite of the URL occurs. As a result, original component URL is exposed. Turning off rewrite 
capabilities proxies the information directly from Bowerâ€™s registry without redirecting to the repository manager 
to retrieve artifacts. The content will be as if navigating directly to the Bower registry in your 
browser.
 
Minimal configuration steps are:

- Define 'Name'
- Define URL for 'Remote storage' e.g. http://bower.herokuapp.com/[http://bower.herokuapp.com]
- Select a 'Blob store' for 'Storage'

[[bower-hosting]]
=== Hosting Bower Repositories

A hosted Bower repository can be used to deploy your own as well as third-party components.

To create another hosted Bower repository, add a new repository with the recipe 'repository-name (hosted)' as 
documented in <<admin-repositories>>.

Minimal configuration steps are:

- Define 'Name'
- Select 'Blob store' for 'Storage'

[[bower-grouping]]
=== Grouping Bower Repositories

A repository group is the recommended way to expose all your Bower repositories from the repository manager to 
your users, without needing any further client side configuration. A repository group allows you to expose the 
aggregated content of multiple proxy and hosted repositories as well as other repository groups with one URL for 
tool configuration. This is possible for Maven repositories by creating a new repository with the 'npm (group)' 
recipe as documented in <<admin-repositories>>.

Minimal configuration steps are:

- Define 'Name'
- Select 'Blob store' for 'Storage'
- Add Maven repositories to the 'Members' list in the desired order

A typical, useful example is the 'Bower-public' group that is configured by default. It aggregates the 
'Bower-central' proxy repository with the 'Bower-releases' and 'Bower-snapshots' hosted repositories. Using the 
'URL' of the repository group gives you access to the packages in all three repositories with one URL. Any new 
component added as well as any new repositories added to the group will automatically be available.

[[bower-installation]]
=== Installing Bower

Before installing the package, make sure you have npm published on Nexus 3. See <<_introduction>> to review configuration if not yet installed and published.

To install from source code:

Bower works by fetching and installing packages from all over; the package manager automatically searches and 
saves them in the repository. Bower keeps track of these packages in a manifest file, +bower.json+. Bower 
provides hooks to facilitate using packages in your tools and workflows.

Now that your repositories are set up in Nexus 3, download the Bower package +.tgz+ file, globally. Then install it with npm:
----
npm install -g foo.tgz
----

You can also build as part of a build of the entire project by specifying the +-Pinclude-bower-resolver+ option.

[[bower-resolver-config]]
=== Configuring the Bower Resolver

You will need to create a +.bowerrc+ file, which you can build in JSON. The JSON in the project's +.bowerrc+ file must reference the resolver you installed. 

You may also install the resolver on a per-project basis instead by adding it as a +devDependency+ in your 
+package.json+:
----
"devDependencies" : {
  "bower-nexus3-resolver" : "*"
}
----

Configure your +.bowerrc+ file to reference the URL for the Bower registry in the repository 
manager:
----
{
    "registry"    : "http://host:port/repository/your-bower-repo",
    "resolvers"   : "bower-nexus3-resolver"
}
----

[[bower-browse-search]]
=== Browsing and Searching Bower Repositories

You can browse Bower repositories in the user interface inspecting the components and assets and their details as 
documented in <<browse-browse>>.

Components can be searched in the user interface as described in <<search-components>>. A search finds all 
components and assets that are currently stored in the repository manager, either because they have been deployed 
to a hosted repository or they have been proxied from an upstream repository and cached in the repository manager.
